And she constrained us. </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt44016016-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44016016-1">16 </span>¶ And it came to pass, as we went to prayer, a certain damsel possessed with a spirit of divination met us, which brought her masters much gain by soothsaying:  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44016017-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44016017-1">17 </span> The same followed Paul and us, and cried, saying, These men are the servants of the most high God, which shew unto us the way of salvation.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44016018-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44016018-1">18 </span> And this did she many days. But Paul, being grieved, turned and said to the spirit, I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her. And he came out the same hour. </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt44016019-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44016019-1">19 </span>¶ And when her masters saw that the hope of their gains was gone, they caught Paul and Silas, and drew <span class="add">them</span> into the marketplace unto the rulers,  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44016020-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44016020-1">20 </span> And brought them to the magistrates, saying, These men, being Jews, do exceedingly trouble our city,  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44016021-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44016021-1">21 </span> And teach customs, which are not lawful for us to receive, neither to observe, being Romans.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44016022-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44016022-1">22 </span> And the multitude rose up together against them: and the magistrates rent off their clothes, and commanded to beat <span class="add">them</span>.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44016023-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44016023-1">23 </span> And when they had laid many stripes upon them, they cast <span class="add">them</span> into prison, charging the jailor to keep them safely:  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44016024-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44016024-1">24 </span> Who, having received such a charge, thrust them into the inner prison, and made their feet fast in the stocks. </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt44016025-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44016025-1">25 </span>¶ And at midnight Paul and Silas prayed, and sang praises unto God: and the prisoners heard them.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44016026-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44016026-1">26 </span> And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken: and immediately all the doors were opened, and every one’s bands were loosed.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44016027-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44016027-1">27 </span> And the keeper of the prison awaking out of his sleep, and seeing the prison doors open, he drew out his sword, and would have killed himself, supposing that the prisoners had been fled.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44016028-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44016028-1">28 </span> But Paul cried with a loud voice, saying, Do thyself no harm: for we are all here.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44016029-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44016029-1">29 </span> Then he called for a light, and sprang in, and came trembling, and fell down before Paul and Silas,  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44016030-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44016030-1">30 </span> And brought them out, and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved?  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44016031-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44016031-1">31 </span> And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44016032-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44016032-1">32 </span> And they spake unto him the word of the Lord, and to all that were in his house.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44016033-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44016033-1">33 </span> And he took them the same hour of the night, and washed <span class="add">their</span> stripes; and was baptized, he and all his, straightway.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44016034-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44016034-1">34 </span> And when he had brought them into his house, he set meat before them, and rejoiced, believing in God with all his house.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44016035-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44016035-1">35 </span> And when it was day, the magistrates sent the serjeants, saying, Let those men go.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44016036-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44016036-1">36 </span> And the keeper of the prison told this saying to Paul, The magistrates have sent to let you go: now therefore depart, and go in peace.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44016037-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44016037-1">37 </span> But Paul said unto them, They have beaten us openly uncondemned, being Romans, and have cast <span class="add">us</span> into prison; and now do they thrust us out privily? nay verily; but let them come themselves and fetch us out.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44016038-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44016038-1">38 </span> And the serjeants told these words unto the magistrates: and they feared, when they heard that they were Romans.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44016039-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44016039-1">39 </span> And they came and besought them, and brought <span class="add">them</span> out, and desired <span class="add">them</span> to depart out of the city.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44016040-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44016040-1">40 </span> And they went out of the prison, and entered into <span class="add">the house of</span> Lydia: and when they had seen the brethren, they comforted them, and departed. </span></p>
