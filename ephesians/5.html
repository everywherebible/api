but be filled with the Spirit;  </span><span class="verse" id="vt49005019-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v49005019-1">19 </span> Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord;  </span><span class="verse" id="vt49005020-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v49005020-1">20 </span> Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ;  </span><span class="verse" id="vt49005021-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v49005021-1">21 </span> Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt49005022-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v49005022-1">22 </span> Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt49005023-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v49005023-1">23 </span> For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt49005024-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v49005024-1">24 </span> Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so <span class="add">let</span> the wives <span class="add">be</span> to their own husbands in every thing.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt49005025-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v49005025-1">25 </span> Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it;
