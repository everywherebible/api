Wot ye not what the scripture saith of Elias? how he maketh intercession to God against Israel, saying,  </span><span class="verse" id="vt45011003-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v45011003-1">3 </span> Lord, they have killed thy prophets, and digged down thine altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt45011004-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v45011004-1">4 </span> But what saith the answer of God unto him? I have reserved to myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to <span class="add">the image of</span> Baal.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt45011005-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v45011005-1">5 </span> Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt45011006-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v45011006-1">6 </span> And if by grace, then <span class="add">is it</span> no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace. But if <span class="add">it be</span> of works, then is it no more grace: otherwise work is no more work. </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt45011007-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v45011007-1">7 </span> What then? Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for; but the election hath obtained it, and the rest were blinded  </span><span class="verse" id="vt45011008-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v45011008-1">8 </span>(According as it is written, God hath given them the spirit of slumber, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear;) unto this day.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt45011009-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v45011009-1">9 </span> And David saith, Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, and a stumblingblock, and a recompence unto them:  </span><span class="verse" id="vt45011010-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v45011010-1">10 </span> Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see, and bow down their back alway.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt45011011-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v45011011-1">11 </span> I say then, Have they stumbled that they should fall?
