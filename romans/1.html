 </span><span class="verse" id="vt45001004-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v45001004-1">4 </span> And declared <span class="add">to be</span> the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead:  </span><span class="verse" id="vt45001005-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v45001005-1">5 </span> By whom we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience to the faith among all nations, for his name:  </span><span class="verse" id="vt45001006-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v45001006-1">6 </span> Among whom are ye also the called of Jesus Christ:  </span><span class="verse" id="vt45001007-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v45001007-1">7 </span> To all that be in Rome, beloved of God, called <span class="add">to be</span> saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ. </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt45001008-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v45001008-1">8 </span> First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt45001009-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v45001009-1">9 </span> For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers;  </span><span class="verse" id="vt45001010-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v45001010-1">10 </span> Making request, if by any means now at length I might have a prosperous journey by the will of God to come unto you.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt45001011-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v45001011-1">11 </span> For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift, to the end ye may be established;  </span><span class="verse" id="vt45001012-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v45001012-1">12 </span> That is, that I may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt45001013-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v45001013-1">13 </span> Now I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that oftentimes I purposed to come unto you, (but was let hitherto,) that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among other Gentiles.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt45001014-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v45001014-1">14 </span> I am debtor both to the Greeks, and to the Barbarians; both to the wise, and to the unwise.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt45001015-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v45001015-1">15 </span> So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at Rome also.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt45001016-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v45001016-1">16 </span> For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt45001017-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v45001017-1">17 </span> For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith. </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt45001018-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v45001018-1">18 </span> For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;  </span><span class="verse" id="vt45001019-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v45001019-1">19 </span> Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath shewed <span class="add">it</span> unto them.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt45001020-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v45001020-1">20 </span> For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, <span class="add">even</span> his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse:  </span><span class="verse" id="vt45001021-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v45001021-1">21 </span> Because that, when they knew God, they glorified <span class="add">him</span> not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt45001022-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v45001022-1">22 </span> Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,  </span><span class="verse" id="vt45001023-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v45001023-1">23 </span> And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things. </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt45001024-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v45001024-1">24 </span> Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves:  </span><span class="verse" id="vt45001025-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v45001025-1">25 </span> Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt45001026-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v45001026-1">26 </span> For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature:  </span><span class="verse" id="vt45001027-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v45001027-1">27 </span> And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt45001028-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v45001028-1">28 </span> And even as they did not like to retain God in <span class="add">their</span> knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient;  </span><span class="verse" id="vt45001029-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v45001029-1">29 </span> Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers,  </span><span class="verse" id="vt45001030-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v45001030-1">30 </span> Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,  </span><span class="verse" id="vt45001031-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v45001031-1">31 </span> Without understanding, covenantbreakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful:  </span><span class="verse" id="vt45001032-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v45001032-1">32 </span> Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them. </span></p>
