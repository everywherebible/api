Doth God take care for oxen?  </span><span class="verse" id="vt46009010-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v46009010-1">10 </span> Or saith he <span class="add">it</span> altogether for our sakes? For our sakes, no doubt, <span class="add">this</span> is written: that he that ploweth should plow in hope; and that he that thresheth in hope should be partaker of his hope.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt46009011-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v46009011-1">11 </span> If we have sown unto you spiritual things, <span class="add">is it</span> a great thing if we shall reap your carnal things?  </span><span class="verse" id="vt46009012-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v46009012-1">12 </span> If others be partakers of <span class="add">this</span> power over you, <span class="add">are</span> not we rather? Nevertheless we have not used this power; but suffer all things, lest we should hinder the gospel of Christ.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt46009013-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v46009013-1">13 </span> Do ye not know that they which minister about holy things live <span class="add">of the things</span> of the temple? and they which wait at the altar are partakers with the altar?  </span><span class="verse" id="vt46009014-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v46009014-1">14 </span> Even so hath the Lord ordained that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt46009015-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v46009015-1">15 </span> But I have used none of these things: neither have I written these things, that it should be so done unto me: for <span class="add">it were</span> better for me to die, than that any man should make my glorying void.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt46009016-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v46009016-1">16 </span> For though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of: for necessity is laid upon me; yea, woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel!  </span><span class="verse" id="vt46009017-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v46009017-1">17 </span> For if I do this thing willingly, I have a reward: but if against my will, a dispensation <span class="add">of the gospel</span> is committed unto me.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt46009018-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v46009018-1">18 </span> What is my reward then? <span class="add">Verily</span> that, when I preach the gospel, I may make the gospel of Christ without charge, that I abuse not my power in the gospel.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt46009019-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v46009019-1">19 </span> For though I be free from all <span class="add">men</span>, yet have I made myself servant unto all, that I might gain the more.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt46009020-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v46009020-1">20 </span> And unto the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews; to them that are under the law, as under the law, that I might gain them that are under the law;  </span><span class="verse" id="vt46009021-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v46009021-1">21 </span> To them that are without law, as without law, (being not without law to God, but under the law to Christ,) that I might gain them that are without law.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt46009022-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v46009022-1">22 </span> To the weak became I as weak, that I might gain the weak: I am made all things to all <span class="add">men</span>, that I might by all means save some.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt46009023-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v46009023-1">23 </span> And this I do for the gospel’s sake, that I might be partaker thereof with <span class="add">you</span>.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt46009024-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v46009024-1">24 </span> Know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize? So run, that ye may obtain.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt46009025-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v46009025-1">25 </span> And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things. Now they <span class="add">do it</span> to obtain a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt46009026-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v46009026-1">26 </span> I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as one that beateth the air:  </span><span class="verse" id="vt46009027-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v46009027-1">27 </span> But I keep under my body, and bring <span class="add">it</span> into subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway. </span></p>
