Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump?  </span><span class="verse" id="vt46005007-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v46005007-1">7 </span> Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened. For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us:  </span><span class="verse" id="vt46005008-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v46005008-1">8 </span> Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened <span class="add">bread</span> of sincerity and truth.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt46005009-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v46005009-1">9 </span> I wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicators:  </span><span class="verse" id="vt46005010-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v46005010-1">10 </span> Yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or extortioners, or with idolaters; for then must ye needs go out of the world.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt46005011-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v46005011-1">11 </span> But now I have written unto you not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such an one no not to eat.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt46005012-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v46005012-1">12 </span> For what have I to do to judge them also that are without? do not ye judge them that are within?  </span><span class="verse" id="vt46005013-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v46005013-1">13 </span> But them that are without God judgeth. Therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person. </span></p>
