Wherefore they said, The blind and the lame shall not come into the house.<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†</a>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt10005009-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v10005009-1">9 </span> So David dwelt in the fort, and called it the city of David. And David built round about from Millo and inward.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt10005010-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v10005010-1">10 </span> And David went on, and grew great, and the <span class="nd">LORD</span> God of hosts <span class="add">was</span> with him.<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡</a> </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt10005011-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v10005011-1">11 </span>¶ And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees, and carpenters, and masons: and they built David an house.<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§</a>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt10005012-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v10005012-1">12 </span> And David perceived that the <span class="nd">LORD</span> had established him king over Israel, and that he had exalted his kingdom for his people Israel’s sake. </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt10005013-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v10005013-1">13 </span>¶ And David took <span class="add">him</span> more concubines and wives out of Jerusalem, after he was come from Hebron: and there were yet sons and daughters born to David.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt10005014-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v10005014-1">14 </span>And these <span class="add">be</span> the names of those that were born unto him in Jerusalem; Shammua, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon,  </span><span class="verse" id="vt10005015-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v10005015-1">15 </span> Ibhar also, and Elishua, and Nepheg, and Japhia,  </span><span class="verse" id="vt10005016-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v10005016-1">16 </span> And Elishama, and Eliada, and Eliphalet. </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt10005017-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v10005017-1">17 </span>¶ But when the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king over Israel, all the Philistines came up to seek David; and David heard <span class="add">of it</span>, and went down to the hold.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt10005018-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v10005018-1">18 </span> The Philistines also came and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt10005019-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v10005019-1">19 </span> And David enquired of the <span class="nd">LORD</span>, saying, Shall I go up to the Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into mine hand? And the <span class="nd">LORD</span> said unto David, Go up: for I will doubtless deliver the Philistines into thine hand.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt10005020-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v10005020-1">20 </span> And David came to Baal-perazim, and David smote them there, and said, The <span class="nd">LORD</span> hath broken forth upon mine enemies before me, as the breach of waters. Therefore he called the name of that place Baal-perazim.<a href="#FN5" class="notemark">**</a>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt10005021-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v10005021-1">21 </span> And there they left their images, and David and his men burned them.<a href="#FN6" class="notemark">††</a> </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt10005022-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v10005022-1">22 </span>¶ And the Philistines came up yet again, and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt10005023-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v10005023-1">23 </span> And when David enquired of the <span class="nd">LORD</span>, he said, Thou shalt not go up; <span class="add">but</span> fetch a compass behind them, and come upon them over against the mulberry trees.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt10005024-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v10005024-1">24 </span> And let it be, when thou hearest the sound of a going in the tops of the mulberry trees, that then thou shalt bestir thyself: for then shall the <span class="nd">LORD</span> go out before thee, to smite the host of the Philistines.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt10005025-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v10005025-1">25 </span> And David did so, as the <span class="nd">LORD</span> had commanded him; and smote the Philistines from Geba until thou come to Gazer.<a href="#FN7" class="notemark">‡‡</a> </span></p>
