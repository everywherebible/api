And Joab and the captains of the host went out from the presence of the king, to number the people of Israel. </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt10024005-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v10024005-1">5 </span>¶ And they passed over Jordan, and pitched in Aroer, on the right side of the city that <span class="add">lieth</span> in the midst of the river of Gad, and toward Jazer:<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†</a>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt10024006-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v10024006-1">6 </span> Then they came to Gilead, and to the land of Tahtim-hodshi; and they came to Dan-jaan, and about to Zidon,<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡</a>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt10024007-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v10024007-1">7 </span> And came to the strong hold of Tyre, and to all the cities of the Hivites, and of the Canaanites: and they went out to the south of Judah, <span class="add">even</span> to Beer-sheba.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt10024008-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v10024008-1">8 </span> So when they had gone through all the land, they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt10024009-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v10024009-1">9 </span> And Joab gave up the sum of the number of the people unto the king: and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men that drew the sword; and the men of Judah <span class="add">were</span> five hundred thousand men. </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt10024010-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v10024010-1">10 </span>¶ And David’s heart smote him after that he had numbered the people. And David said unto the <span class="nd">LORD</span>, I have sinned greatly in that I have done: and now, I beseech thee, O <span class="nd">LORD</span>, take away the iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt10024011-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v10024011-1">11 </span> For when David was up in the morning, the word of the <span class="nd">LORD</span> came unto the prophet Gad, David’s seer, saying,  </span><span class="verse" id="vt10024012-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v10024012-1">12 </span> Go and say unto David, Thus saith the <span class="nd">LORD</span>, I offer thee three <span class="add">things;</span> choose  thee one of them, that I may <span class="add">do it</span> unto thee.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt10024013-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v10024013-1">13 </span> So Gad came to David, and told him, and said unto him, Shall seven years of famine come unto thee in thy land? or wilt thou flee three months before thine enemies, while they pursue thee? or that there be three days’ pestilence in thy land? now advise, and see what answer I shall return to him that sent me.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt10024014-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v10024014-1">14 </span> And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let us fall now into the hand of the <span class="nd">LORD</span>; for his mercies <span class="add">are</span> great: and let me not fall into the hand of man.<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§</a> </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt10024015-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v10024015-1">15 </span>¶ So the <span class="nd">LORD</span> sent a pestilence upon Israel from the morning even to the time appointed: and there died of the people from Dan even to Beer-sheba seventy thousand men.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt10024016-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v10024016-1">16 </span> And when the angel stretched out his hand upon Jerusalem to destroy it, the <span class="nd">LORD</span> repented him of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed the people, It is enough: stay now thine hand. And the angel of the <span class="nd">LORD</span> was by the threshingplace of Araunah the Jebusite.<a href="#FN5" class="notemark">**</a>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt10024017-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v10024017-1">17 </span> And David spake unto the <span class="nd">LORD</span> when he saw the angel that smote the people, and said, Lo, I have sinned, and I have done wickedly: but these sheep, what have they done? let thine hand, I pray thee, be against me, and against my father’s house. </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt10024018-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v10024018-1">18 </span>¶ And Gad came that day to David, and said unto him, Go up, rear an altar unto the <span class="nd">LORD</span> in the threshingfloor of Araunah the Jebusite.<a href="#FN6" class="notemark">††</a>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt10024019-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v10024019-1">19 </span> And David, according to the saying of Gad, went up as the <span class="nd">LORD</span> commanded.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt10024020-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v10024020-1">20 </span> And Araunah looked, and saw the king and his servants coming on toward him: and Araunah went out, and bowed himself before the king on his face upon the ground.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt10024021-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v10024021-1">21 </span> And Araunah said, Wherefore is my lord the king come to his servant? And David said, To buy the threshingfloor of thee, to build an altar unto the <span class="nd">LORD</span>, that the plague may be stayed from the people.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt10024022-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v10024022-1">22 </span> And Araunah said unto David, Let my lord the king take and offer up what <span class="add">seemeth</span> good unto him: behold, <span class="add">here be</span> oxen for burnt sacrifice, and threshing instruments and <span class="add">other</span> instruments of the oxen for wood.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt10024023-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v10024023-1">23 </span>All these <span class="add">things</span> did Araunah, <span class="add">as</span> a king, give unto the king. And Araunah said unto the king, The <span class="nd">LORD</span> thy God accept  thee.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt10024024-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v10024024-1">24 </span> And the king said unto Araunah, Nay; but I will surely buy <span class="add">it</span> of thee at a price: neither will I offer burnt offerings unto the <span class="nd">LORD</span> my God of that which doth cost me nothing. So David bought the threshingfloor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt10024025-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v10024025-1">25 </span> And David built there an altar unto the <span class="nd">LORD</span>, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. So the <span class="nd">LORD</span> was intreated for the land, and the plague was stayed from Israel. </span></p>
