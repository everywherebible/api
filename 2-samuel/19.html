For thou hast declared this day, that thou regardest neither princes nor servants: for this day I perceive, that if Absalom had lived, and all we had died this day, then it had pleased thee well.<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†</a><a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡</a>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt10019007-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v10019007-1">7 </span> Now therefore arise, go forth, and speak comfortably unto thy servants: for I swear by the <span class="nd">LORD</span>, if thou go not forth, there will not tarry one with thee this night: and that will be worse unto thee than all the evil that befell thee from thy youth until now.<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§</a>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt10019008-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v10019008-1">8 </span> Then the king arose, and sat in the gate.
