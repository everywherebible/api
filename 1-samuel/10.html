Now therefore present yourselves before the <span class="nd">LORD</span> by your tribes, and by your thousands.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt09010020-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v09010020-1">20 </span> And when Samuel had caused all the tribes of Israel to come near, the tribe of Benjamin was taken.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt09010021-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v09010021-1">21 </span> When he had caused the tribe of Benjamin to come near by their families, the family of Matri was taken, and Saul the son of Kish was taken: and when they sought him, he could not be found.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt09010022-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v09010022-1">22 </span> Therefore they enquired of the <span class="nd">LORD</span> further, if the man should yet come thither.

And all the people shouted, and said, God save the king.<a href="#FN9" class="notemark">***</a>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt09010025-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v09010025-1">25 </span> Then Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom, and wrote <span class="add">it</span> in a book, and laid <span class="add">it</span> up before the <span class="nd">LORD</span>. And Samuel sent all the people away, every man to his house. </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt09010026-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v09010026-1">26 </span>¶ And Saul also went home to Gibeah; and there went with him a band of men, whose hearts God had touched.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt09010027-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v09010027-1">27 </span> But the children of Belial said, How shall this man save us?
