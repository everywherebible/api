And <span class="add">one</span> said, Behold, <span class="add">they be</span> at Naioth in Ramah.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt09019023-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v09019023-1">23 </span> And he went thither to Naioth in Ramah: and the Spirit of God was upon him also, and he went on, and prophesied, until he came to Naioth in Ramah.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt09019024-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v09019024-1">24 </span> And he stripped off his clothes also, and prophesied before Samuel in like manner, and lay down naked all that day and all that night.
