And the <span class="nd">LORD</span> said, Take an heifer with thee, and say, I am come to sacrifice to the <span class="nd">LORD</span>.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*</a>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt09016003-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v09016003-1">3 </span> And call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will shew thee what thou shalt do: and thou shalt anoint unto me <span class="add">him</span> whom I name unto thee.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt09016004-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v09016004-1">4 </span> And Samuel did that which the <span class="nd">LORD</span> spake, and came to Beth-lehem. And the elders of the town trembled  at his coming, and said, Comest thou peaceably?<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†</a>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt09016005-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v09016005-1">5 </span> And he said, Peaceably: I am come to sacrifice unto the <span class="nd">LORD</span>: sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice. And he sanctified Jesse and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice. </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt09016006-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v09016006-1">6 </span>¶ And it came to pass, when they were come, that he looked on Eliab, and said, Surely the <span class="nd">LORD’s</span> anointed <span class="add">is</span> before him.<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡</a>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt09016007-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v09016007-1">7 </span> But the <span class="nd">LORD</span> said unto Samuel, Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; because I have refused him: for <span class="add">the <span class="nd">Lord</span> seeth</span> not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the <span class="nd">LORD</span> looketh on the heart.<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§</a>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt09016008-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v09016008-1">8 </span> Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. And he said, Neither hath the <span class="nd">LORD</span> chosen this.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt09016009-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v09016009-1">9 </span> Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. And he said, Neither hath the <span class="nd">LORD</span> chosen this.<a href="#FN5" class="notemark">**</a>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt09016010-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v09016010-1">10 </span> Again, Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. And Samuel said unto Jesse, The <span class="nd">LORD</span> hath not chosen these.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt09016011-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v09016011-1">11 </span> And Samuel said unto Jesse, Are here all <span class="add">thy</span> children? And he said, There remaineth yet the youngest, and, behold, he keepeth the sheep. And Samuel said unto Jesse, Send and fetch him: for we will not sit down till he come hither.<a href="#FN6" class="notemark">††</a>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt09016012-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v09016012-1">12 </span> And he sent, and brought him in. Now he <span class="add">was</span> ruddy, <span class="add">and</span> withal of a beautiful countenance, and goodly to look to. And the <span class="nd">LORD</span> said, Arise, anoint him: for this <span class="add">is</span> he.<a href="#FN7" class="notemark">‡‡</a>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt09016013-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v09016013-1">13 </span> Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brethren: and the Spirit of the <span class="nd">LORD</span> came upon David from that day forward. So Samuel rose up, and went to Ramah. </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt09016014-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v09016014-1">14 </span>¶ But the Spirit of the <span class="nd">LORD</span> departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the <span class="nd">LORD</span> troubled him.<a href="#FN8" class="notemark">§§</a>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt09016015-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v09016015-1">15 </span> And Saul’s servants said unto him, Behold now, an evil spirit from God troubleth thee.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt09016016-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v09016016-1">16 </span> Let our lord now command thy servants, <span class="add">which are</span> before thee, to seek out a man, <span class="add">who is</span> a cunning player on an harp: and it shall come to pass, when the evil spirit from God is upon thee, that he shall play with his hand, and thou shalt be well.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt09016017-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v09016017-1">17 </span> And Saul said unto his servants, Provide me now a man that can play well, and bring <span class="add">him</span> to me.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt09016018-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v09016018-1">18 </span> Then answered one of the servants, and said, Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Beth-lehemite, <span class="add">that is</span> cunning in playing, and a mighty valiant man, and a man of war, and prudent in matters, and a comely person, and the <span class="nd">LORD</span> <span class="add">is</span> with him.<a href="#FN9" class="notemark">***</a> </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt09016019-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v09016019-1">19 </span>¶ Wherefore Saul sent messengers unto Jesse, and said, Send me David thy son, which <span class="add">is</span> with the sheep.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt09016020-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v09016020-1">20 </span> And Jesse took an ass <span class="add">laden</span> with bread, and a bottle of wine, and a kid, and sent <span class="add">them</span> by David his son unto Saul.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt09016021-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v09016021-1">21 </span> And David came to Saul, and stood before him: and he loved him greatly; and he became his armourbearer.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt09016022-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v09016022-1">22 </span> And Saul sent to Jesse, saying, Let David, I pray thee, stand before me; for he hath found favour in my sight.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt09016023-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v09016023-1">23 </span>And it came to pass, when the <span class="add">evil</span> spirit from God was upon Saul, that David took an harp, and played with his hand: so Saul was refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit departed from him. </span></p>
