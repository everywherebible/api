Then David arose, and cut off the skirt of Saul’s robe privily.<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†</a>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt09024005-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v09024005-1">5 </span> And it came to pass afterward, that David’s heart smote him, because he had cut off Saul’s skirt.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt09024006-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v09024006-1">6 </span> And he said unto his men, The <span class="nd">LORD</span> forbid that I should do this thing unto my master, the <span class="nd">LORD’s</span> anointed, to stretch forth mine hand against him, seeing he <span class="add">is</span> the anointed of the <span class="nd">LORD</span>.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt09024007-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v09024007-1">7 </span> So David stayed his servants with these words, and suffered them not to rise against Saul. But Saul rose up out of the cave, and went on <span class="add">his</span> way.<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡</a>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt09024008-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v09024008-1">8 </span> David also arose afterward, and went out of the cave, and cried after Saul, saying, My lord the king. And when Saul looked  behind him, David stooped with his face to the earth, and bowed himself. </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt09024009-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v09024009-1">9 </span>¶ And David said to Saul, Wherefore hearest thou men’s words, saying, Behold, David seeketh thy hurt?  </span><span class="verse" id="vt09024010-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v09024010-1">10 </span> Behold, this day thine eyes have seen how that the <span class="nd">LORD</span> had delivered thee to day into mine hand in the cave: and <span class="add">some</span> bade <span class="add">me</span> kill thee: but <span class="add">mine eye</span> spared thee; and I said, I will not put forth mine hand against my lord; for he <span class="add">is</span> the <span class="nd">LORD’s</span> anointed.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt09024011-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v09024011-1">11 </span> Moreover, my father, see, yea, see the skirt of thy robe in my hand: for in that I cut off the skirt of thy robe, and killed thee not, know thou and see that <span class="add">there is</span> neither evil nor transgression in mine hand, and I have not sinned against thee; yet thou huntest my soul to take it.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt09024012-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v09024012-1">12 </span> The <span class="nd">LORD</span> judge between me and thee, and the <span class="nd">LORD</span> avenge me of thee: but mine hand shall not be upon thee.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt09024013-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v09024013-1">13 </span> As saith the proverb of the ancients, Wickedness proceedeth  from the wicked: but mine hand shall not be upon thee.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt09024014-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v09024014-1">14 </span> After whom is the king of Israel come out? after whom dost thou pursue? after a dead dog, after a flea.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt09024015-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v09024015-1">15 </span> The <span class="nd">LORD</span> therefore be judge, and judge between me and thee, and see, and plead my cause, and deliver me out of thine hand.<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§</a> </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt09024016-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v09024016-1">16 </span>¶ And it came to pass, when David had made an end of speaking these words unto Saul, that Saul said, <span class="add">Is</span> this thy voice, my son David? And Saul lifted up his voice, and wept.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt09024017-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v09024017-1">17 </span> And he said to David, Thou <span class="add">art</span> more righteous than I: for thou hast rewarded me good, whereas I have rewarded thee evil.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt09024018-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v09024018-1">18 </span> And thou hast shewed this day how that thou hast dealt well with me: forasmuch as when the <span class="nd">LORD</span> had delivered me into thine hand, thou killedst me not.<a href="#FN5" class="notemark">**</a>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt09024019-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v09024019-1">19 </span> For if a man find his enemy, will he let him go well away? wherefore the <span class="nd">LORD</span> reward thee good for that thou hast done unto me this day.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt09024020-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v09024020-1">20 </span> And now, behold, I know well that thou shalt surely be king, and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in thine hand.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt09024021-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v09024021-1">21 </span> Swear now therefore unto me by the <span class="nd">LORD</span>, that thou wilt not cut off my seed after me, and that thou wilt not destroy my name out of my father’s house.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt09024022-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v09024022-1">22 </span> And David sware unto Saul. And Saul went home; but David and his men gat them up unto the hold. </span></p>
