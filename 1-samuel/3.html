And the word of the <span class="nd">LORD</span> was precious in those days; <span class="add">there was</span> no open vision.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt09003002-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v09003002-1">2 </span> And it came to pass at that time, when Eli <span class="add">was</span> laid down in his place, and his eyes began to wax dim, <span class="add">that</span> he could not see;  </span><span class="verse" id="vt09003003-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v09003003-1">3 </span> And ere the lamp of God went out in the temple of the <span class="nd">LORD</span>, where the ark of God <span class="add">was</span>, and Samuel was laid down <span class="add">to sleep;</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt09003004-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v09003004-1">4 </span> That the <span class="nd">LORD</span> called Samuel: and he answered, Here <span class="add">am</span> I.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt09003005-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v09003005-1">5 </span> And he ran unto Eli, and said, Here <span class="add">am</span> I; for thou calledst me. And he said, I called not; lie down again. And he went and lay down.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt09003006-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v09003006-1">6 </span> And the <span class="nd">LORD</span> called yet again, Samuel. And Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, Here <span class="add">am</span> I; for thou didst call me. And he answered, I called not, my son; lie down again.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt09003007-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v09003007-1">7 </span> Now Samuel did not yet know the <span class="nd">LORD</span>, neither was the word of the <span class="nd">LORD</span> yet revealed unto him.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*</a>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt09003008-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v09003008-1">8 </span> And the <span class="nd">LORD</span> called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli, and said, Here <span class="add">am</span> I; for thou didst call me. And Eli perceived that the <span class="nd">LORD</span> had called the child.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt09003009-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v09003009-1">9 </span> Therefore Eli said unto Samuel, Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, <span class="nd">LORD</span>; for thy servant heareth. So Samuel went and lay down in his place.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt09003010-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v09003010-1">10 </span> And the <span class="nd">LORD</span> came, and stood, and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel answered, Speak; for thy servant heareth. </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt09003011-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v09003011-1">11 </span>¶ And the <span class="nd">LORD</span> said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt09003012-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v09003012-1">12 </span> In that day I will perform against Eli all <span class="add">things</span> which I have spoken concerning his house: when I begin, I will also make an end.<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†</a>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt09003013-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v09003013-1">13 </span> For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever for the iniquity which he knoweth; because his sons made themselves vile, and he restrained them not.<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡</a><a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§</a><a href="#FN5" class="notemark">**</a>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt09003014-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v09003014-1">14 </span> And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli’s house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor offering for ever. </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt09003015-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v09003015-1">15 </span>¶ And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of the <span class="nd">LORD</span>. And Samuel feared to shew Eli the vision.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt09003016-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v09003016-1">16 </span> Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he answered, Here <span class="add">am</span> I.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt09003017-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v09003017-1">17 </span> And he said, What <span class="add">is</span> the thing that <span class="add">the <span class="nd">Lord</span></span> hath said unto thee? I pray thee hide <span class="add">it</span> not from me: God do so to thee, and more also, if thou hide <span class="add">any</span> thing from me of all the things that he said unto thee.<a href="#FN6" class="notemark">††</a><a href="#FN7" class="notemark">‡‡</a>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt09003018-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v09003018-1">18 </span> And Samuel told him every whit, and hid nothing from him. And he said, It <span class="add">is</span> the <span class="nd">LORD</span>: let him do what seemeth him good.<a href="#FN8" class="notemark">§§</a> </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt09003019-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v09003019-1">19 </span>¶ And Samuel grew, and the <span class="nd">LORD</span> was with him, and did let none of his words fall to the ground.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt09003020-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v09003020-1">20 </span> And all Israel from Dan even to Beer-sheba knew that Samuel <span class="add">was</span> established  <span class="add">to be</span> a prophet of the <span class="nd">LORD</span>.<a href="#FN9" class="notemark">***</a>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt09003021-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v09003021-1">21 </span> And the <span class="nd">LORD</span> appeared  again in Shiloh: for the <span class="nd">LORD</span> revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the <span class="nd">LORD</span>. </span></p>
