And the <span class="nd">LORD</span> said unto David, Go, and smite the Philistines, and save Keilah.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt09023003-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v09023003-1">3 </span> And David’s men said unto him, Behold, we be afraid here in Judah: how much more then if we come to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines?  </span><span class="verse" id="vt09023004-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v09023004-1">4 </span> Then David enquired of the <span class="nd">LORD</span> yet again. And the <span class="nd">LORD</span> answered him and said, Arise, go down to Keilah; for I will deliver the Philistines into thine hand.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt09023005-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v09023005-1">5 </span> So David and his men went to Keilah, and fought with the Philistines, and brought away their cattle, and smote them with a great slaughter. So David saved the inhabitants of Keilah.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt09023006-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v09023006-1">6 </span> And it came to pass, when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David to Keilah, <span class="add">that</span> he came down <span class="add">with</span> an ephod in his hand. </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt09023007-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v09023007-1">7 </span>¶ And it was told Saul that David was come to Keilah. And Saul said, God hath delivered him into mine hand; for he is shut in, by entering into a town that hath gates and bars.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt09023008-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v09023008-1">8 </span> And Saul called all the people together to war, to go down to Keilah, to besiege David and his men. </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt09023009-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v09023009-1">9 </span>¶ And David knew that Saul secretly practised mischief against him; and he said to Abiathar the priest, Bring hither the ephod.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt09023010-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v09023010-1">10 </span> Then said David, O <span class="nd">LORD</span> God of Israel, thy servant hath certainly heard that Saul seeketh to come to Keilah, to destroy the city for my sake.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt09023011-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v09023011-1">11 </span> Will the men of Keilah deliver me up into his hand? will Saul come down, as thy servant hath heard? O <span class="nd">LORD</span> God of Israel, I beseech thee, tell thy servant. And the <span class="nd">LORD</span> said, He will come down.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt09023012-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v09023012-1">12 </span> Then said David, Will the men of Keilah deliver me and my men into the hand of Saul? And the <span class="nd">LORD</span> said, They will deliver <span class="add">thee</span> up.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*</a> </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt09023013-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v09023013-1">13 </span>¶ Then David and his men, <span class="add">which were</span> about six hundred, arose and departed out of Keilah, and went whithersoever they could go. And it was told Saul that David was escaped from Keilah; and he forbare to go forth. </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt09023014-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v09023014-1">14 </span> And David abode in the wilderness in strong holds, and remained in a mountain in the wilderness of Ziph.
