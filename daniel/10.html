And when he had spoken this word unto me, I stood trembling.<a href="#FN7" class="notemark">‡‡</a><a href="#FN8" class="notemark">§§</a>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt27010012-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v27010012-1">12 </span> Then said he unto me, Fear not, Daniel: for from the first day that thou didst set thine heart to understand, and to chasten thyself before thy God, thy words were heard, and I am come for thy words.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt27010013-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v27010013-1">13 </span> But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood  me one and twenty days: but, lo, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me; and I remained there with the kings of Persia.<a href="#FN9" class="notemark">***</a>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt27010014-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v27010014-1">14 </span> Now I am come to make thee understand what shall befall thy people in the latter days: for yet the vision <span class="add">is</span> for <span class="add">many</span> days.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt27010015-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v27010015-1">15 </span> And when he had spoken such words unto me, I set my face toward the ground, and I became dumb.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt27010016-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v27010016-1">16 </span>And, behold, <span class="add">one</span> like the similitude of the sons of men touched my lips: then I opened my mouth, and spake, and said unto him that stood before me, O my lord, by the vision my sorrows are turned upon me, and I have retained no strength.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt27010017-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v27010017-1">17 </span> For how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my lord? for as for me, straightway there remained no strength in me, neither is there breath left in me.<a href="#FN10" class="notemark">†††</a>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt27010018-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v27010018-1">18 </span> Then there came again and touched me <span class="add">one</span> like the appearance of a man, and he strengthened me,  </span><span class="verse" id="vt27010019-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v27010019-1">19 </span> And said, O man greatly beloved, fear not: peace <span class="add">be</span> unto thee, be strong, yea, be strong. And when he had spoken unto me, I was strengthened, and said, Let my lord speak; for thou hast strengthened me.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt27010020-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v27010020-1">20 </span> Then said he, Knowest thou wherefore I come unto thee? and now will I return to fight with the prince of Persia: and when I am gone forth, lo, the prince of Grecia shall come.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt27010021-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v27010021-1">21 </span> But I will shew thee that which is noted in the scripture of truth: and <span class="add">there is</span> none that holdeth with me in these things, but Michael your prince.<a href="#FN11" class="notemark">‡‡‡</a> </span></p>
