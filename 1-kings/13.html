And his hand, which he put forth against him, dried up, so that he could not pull it in again to him.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt11013005-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v11013005-1">5 </span> The altar also was rent, and the ashes poured out from the altar, according to the sign which the man of God had given by the word of the <span class="nd">LORD</span>.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt11013006-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v11013006-1">6 </span> And the king answered and said unto the man of God, Intreat now the face of the <span class="nd">LORD</span> thy God, and pray for me, that my hand may be restored me again.
