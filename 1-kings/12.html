So Israel departed unto their tents.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt11012017-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v11012017-1">17 </span>But <span class="add">as for</span> the children of Israel which dwelt in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt11012018-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v11012018-1">18 </span> Then king Rehoboam sent Adoram, who <span class="add">was</span> over the tribute; and all Israel stoned him with stones, that he died. Therefore king Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem.<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†</a>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt11012019-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v11012019-1">19 </span> So Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day.<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡</a>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt11012020-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v11012020-1">20 </span> And it came to pass, when all Israel heard that Jeroboam was come again, that they sent and called him unto the congregation, and made him king over all Israel: there was none that followed the house of David, but the tribe of Judah only. </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt11012021-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v11012021-1">21 </span>¶ And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he assembled all the house of Judah, with the tribe of Benjamin, an hundred and fourscore thousand chosen men, which were warriors, to fight against the house of Israel, to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam the son of Solomon.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt11012022-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v11012022-1">22 </span> But the word of God came unto Shemaiah the man of God, saying,  </span><span class="verse" id="vt11012023-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v11012023-1">23 </span> Speak unto Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and unto all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the remnant of the people, saying,  </span><span class="verse" id="vt11012024-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v11012024-1">24 </span> Thus saith the <span class="nd">LORD</span>, Ye shall not go up, nor fight against your brethren the children of Israel: return every man to his house; for this thing is from me. They hearkened therefore to the word of the <span class="nd">LORD</span>, and returned to depart, according to the word of the <span class="nd">LORD</span>. </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt11012025-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v11012025-1">25 </span>¶ Then Jeroboam built Shechem in mount Ephraim, and dwelt therein; and went out from thence, and built Penuel.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt11012026-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v11012026-1">26 </span> And Jeroboam said in his heart, Now shall the kingdom return to the house of David:  </span><span class="verse" id="vt11012027-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v11012027-1">27 </span> If this people go up to do sacrifice in the house of the <span class="nd">LORD</span> at Jerusalem, then shall the heart of this people turn again unto their lord, <span class="add">even</span> unto Rehoboam king of Judah, and they shall kill me, and go again to Rehoboam king of Judah.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt11012028-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v11012028-1">28 </span> Whereupon the king took counsel, and made two calves <span class="add">of</span> gold, and said unto them, It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem: behold thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt11012029-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v11012029-1">29 </span> And he set the one in Beth-el, and the other put he in Dan.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt11012030-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v11012030-1">30 </span> And this thing became a sin: for the people went <span class="add">to worship</span> before the one, <span class="add">even</span> unto Dan.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt11012031-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v11012031-1">31 </span> And he made an house of high places, and made priests of the lowest of the people, which were not of the sons of Levi.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt11012032-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v11012032-1">32 </span> And Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, like unto the feast that <span class="add">is</span> in Judah, and he offered upon the altar. So did he in Beth-el, sacrificing unto the calves that he had made: and he placed in Beth-el the priests of the high places which he had made.<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§</a><a href="#FN5" class="notemark">**</a>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt11012033-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v11012033-1">33 </span> So he offered upon the altar which he had made in Beth-el the fifteenth day of the eighth month, <span class="add">even</span> in the month which he had devised of his own heart; and ordained a feast unto the children of Israel: and he offered upon the altar, and burnt incense.<a href="#FN6" class="notemark">††</a><a href="#FN7" class="notemark">‡‡</a> </span></p>
