And she said, Comest thou peaceably? And he said, Peaceably.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt11002014-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v11002014-1">14 </span> He said moreover, I have somewhat to say unto thee.

And the king rose up to meet her, and bowed himself unto her, and sat down on his throne, and caused a seat to be set for the king’s mother; and she sat on his right hand.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt11002020-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v11002020-1">20 </span> Then she said, I desire one small petition of thee; <span class="add">I pray thee</span>, say me not nay. And the king said unto her, Ask on, my mother: for I will not say thee nay.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt11002021-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v11002021-1">21 </span> And she said, Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah thy brother to wife.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt11002022-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v11002022-1">22 </span> And king Solomon answered and said unto his mother, And why dost thou ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? ask for him the kingdom also; for he <span class="add">is</span> mine elder brother; even for him, and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt11002023-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v11002023-1">23 </span> Then king Solomon sware by the <span class="nd">LORD</span>, saying, God do so to me, and more also, if Adonijah have not spoken this word against his own life.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt11002024-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v11002024-1">24 </span>Now therefore, <span class="add">as</span> the <span class="nd">LORD</span> liveth, which hath established me, and set me on the throne of David my father, and who hath made me an house, as he promised, Adonijah shall be put to death this day.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt11002025-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v11002025-1">25 </span> And king Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he fell upon him that he died. </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt11002026-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v11002026-1">26 </span>¶ And unto Abiathar the priest said the king, Get thee to Anathoth, unto thine own fields; for thou <span class="add">art</span> worthy of death: but I will not at this time put thee to death, because thou barest the ark of the Lord <span class="nd">GOD</span> before David my father, and because thou hast been afflicted in all wherein my father was afflicted.<a href="#FN6" class="notemark">††</a>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt11002027-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v11002027-1">27 </span> So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest unto the <span class="nd">LORD</span>; that he might fulfil the word of the <span class="nd">LORD</span>, which he spake concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh. </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt11002028-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v11002028-1">28 </span>¶ Then tidings came to Joab: for Joab had turned after Adonijah, though he turned not after Absalom. And Joab fled unto the tabernacle of the <span class="nd">LORD</span>, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt11002029-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v11002029-1">29 </span> And it was told king Solomon that Joab was fled unto the tabernacle of the <span class="nd">LORD</span>; and, behold, <span class="add">he is</span> by the altar. Then Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying, Go, fall upon him.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt11002030-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v11002030-1">30 </span> And Benaiah came to the tabernacle of the <span class="nd">LORD</span>, and said unto him, Thus saith the king, Come forth. And he said, Nay; but I will die here. And Benaiah brought the king word again, saying, Thus said Joab, and thus he answered me.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt11002031-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v11002031-1">31 </span> And the king said unto him, Do as he hath said, and fall upon him, and bury him; that thou mayest take away the innocent blood, which Joab shed, from me, and from the house of my father.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt11002032-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v11002032-1">32 </span> And the <span class="nd">LORD</span> shall return his blood upon his own head, who fell upon two men more righteous and better than he, and slew them with the sword, my father David not knowing <span class="add">thereof, to wit</span>, Abner the son of Ner, captain of the host of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether, captain of the host of Judah.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt11002033-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v11002033-1">33 </span> Their blood shall therefore return upon the head of Joab, and upon the head of his seed for ever: but upon David, and upon his seed, and upon his house, and upon his throne, shall there be peace for ever from the <span class="nd">LORD</span>.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt11002034-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v11002034-1">34 </span> So Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up, and fell upon him, and slew him: and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness. </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt11002035-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v11002035-1">35 </span>¶ And the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his room over the host: and Zadok the priest did the king put in the room of Abiathar. </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt11002036-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v11002036-1">36 </span>¶ And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Build thee an house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and go not forth thence any whither.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt11002037-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v11002037-1">37 </span>For it shall be, <span class="add">that</span> on the day thou goest out, and passest over the brook Kidron, thou shalt know for certain that thou shalt surely die: thy blood shall be upon thine own head.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt11002038-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v11002038-1">38 </span> And Shimei said unto the king, The saying <span class="add">is</span> good: as my lord the king hath said, so will thy servant do. And Shimei dwelt in Jerusalem many days.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt11002039-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v11002039-1">39 </span> And it came to pass at the end of three years, that two of the servants of Shimei ran away unto Achish son of Maachah king of Gath. And they told Shimei, saying, Behold, thy servants <span class="add">be</span> in Gath.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt11002040-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v11002040-1">40 </span> And Shimei arose, and saddled his ass, and went to Gath to Achish to seek his servants: and Shimei went, and brought his servants from Gath.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt11002041-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v11002041-1">41 </span> And it was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath, and was come again.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt11002042-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v11002042-1">42 </span> And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Did I not make thee to swear by the <span class="nd">LORD</span>, and protested unto thee, saying, Know for a certain, on the day thou goest out, and walkest abroad any whither, that thou shalt surely die? and thou saidst unto me, The word <span class="add">that</span> I have heard <span class="add">is</span> good.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt11002043-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v11002043-1">43 </span> Why then hast thou not kept the oath of the <span class="nd">LORD</span>, and the commandment that I have charged thee with?  </span><span class="verse" id="vt11002044-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v11002044-1">44 </span> The king said moreover to Shimei, Thou knowest all the wickedness which thine heart is privy to, that thou didst to David my father: therefore the <span class="nd">LORD</span> shall return thy wickedness upon thine own head;  </span><span class="verse" id="vt11002045-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v11002045-1">45 </span> And king Solomon <span class="add">shall be</span> blessed, and the throne of David shall be established before the <span class="nd">LORD</span> for ever.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt11002046-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v11002046-1">46 </span> So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; which went out, and fell upon him, that he died. And the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon. </span></p>
