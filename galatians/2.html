God forbid.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt48002018-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v48002018-1">18 </span> For if I build again the things which I destroyed, I make myself a transgressor.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt48002019-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v48002019-1">19 </span> For I through the law am dead to the law, that I might live unto God.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt48002020-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v48002020-1">20 </span> I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt48002021-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v48002021-1">21 </span> I do not frustrate the grace of God: for if righteousness <span class="add">come</span> by the law, then Christ is dead in vain. </span></p>
