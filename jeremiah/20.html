Then said Jeremiah unto him, The <span class="nd">LORD</span> hath not called thy name Pashur, but Magor-missabib.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*</a>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt24020004-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v24020004-1">4 </span> For thus saith the <span class="nd">LORD</span>, Behold, I will make thee a terror to thyself, and to all thy friends: and they shall fall by the sword of their enemies, and thine eyes shall behold <span class="add">it:</span> and I will give all Judah into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall carry them captive into Babylon, and shall slay them with the sword.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt24020005-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v24020005-1">5 </span> Moreover I will deliver all the strength of this city, and all the labours thereof, and all the precious things thereof, and all the treasures of the kings of Judah will I give into the hand of their enemies, which shall spoil them, and take them, and carry them to Babylon.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt24020006-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v24020006-1">6 </span> And thou, Pashur, and all that dwell in thine house shall go into captivity: and thou shalt come to Babylon, and there thou shalt die, and shalt be buried there, thou, and all thy friends, to whom thou hast prophesied lies. </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt24020007-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v24020007-1">7 </span>¶ O <span class="nd">LORD</span>, thou hast deceived me, and I was deceived: thou art stronger than I, and hast prevailed: I am in derision daily, every one mocketh me.<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†</a>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt24020008-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v24020008-1">8 </span> For since I spake, I cried out, I cried violence and spoil; because the word of the <span class="nd">LORD</span> was made a reproach unto me, and a derision, daily.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt24020009-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v24020009-1">9 </span> Then I said, I will not make mention of him, nor speak any more in his name.
