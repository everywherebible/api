<span class="add">as</span> a consuming fire he shall destroy them, and he shall bring them down before thy face: so shalt thou drive them out, and destroy them quickly, as the <span class="nd">LORD</span> hath said unto thee.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt05009004-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v05009004-1">4 </span> Speak not thou in thine heart, after that the <span class="nd">LORD</span> thy God hath cast them out from before thee, saying, For my righteousness the <span class="nd">LORD</span> hath brought me in to possess this land: but for the wickedness of these nations the <span class="nd">LORD</span> doth drive them out from before thee.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt05009005-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v05009005-1">5 </span> Not for thy righteousness, or for the uprightness of thine heart, dost thou go to possess their land: but for the wickedness of these nations the <span class="nd">LORD</span> thy God doth drive them out from before thee, and that he may perform the word which the <span class="nd">LORD</span> sware unto thy fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt05009006-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v05009006-1">6 </span> Understand therefore, that the <span class="nd">LORD</span> thy God giveth thee not this good land to possess it for thy righteousness;

and on them <span class="add">was written</span> according to all the words, which the <span class="nd">LORD</span> spake with you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt05009011-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v05009011-1">11 </span> And it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights, <span class="add">that</span> the <span class="nd">LORD</span> gave me the two tables of stone, <span class="add">even</span> the tables of the covenant.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt05009012-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v05009012-1">12 </span> And the <span class="nd">LORD</span> said unto me, Arise, get thee down quickly from hence; for thy people which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt have corrupted <span class="add">themselves;</span> they are quickly turned aside out of the way which I commanded them; they have made them a molten image.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt05009013-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v05009013-1">13 </span> Furthermore the <span class="nd">LORD</span> spake unto me, saying, I have seen this people, and, behold, it <span class="add">is</span> a stiffnecked people:  </span><span class="verse" id="vt05009014-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v05009014-1">14 </span> Let me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their name from under heaven: and I will make of thee a nation mightier and greater than they.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt05009015-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v05009015-1">15 </span> So I turned and came down from the mount, and the mount burned with fire: and the two tables of the covenant <span class="add">were</span> in my two hands.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt05009016-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v05009016-1">16 </span> And I looked, and, behold, ye had sinned against the <span class="nd">LORD</span> your God, <span class="add">and</span> had made you a molten calf: ye had turned aside quickly out of the way which the <span class="nd">LORD</span> had commanded you.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt05009017-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v05009017-1">17 </span> And I took the two tables, and cast them out of my two hands, and brake them before your eyes.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt05009018-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v05009018-1">18 </span> And I fell down before the <span class="nd">LORD</span>, as at the first, forty days and forty nights: I did neither eat bread, nor drink water, because of all your sins which ye sinned, in doing wickedly in the sight of the <span class="nd">LORD</span>, to provoke him to anger.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt05009019-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v05009019-1">19 </span> For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure, wherewith the <span class="nd">LORD</span> was wroth against you to destroy you. But the <span class="nd">LORD</span> hearkened unto me at that time also.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt05009020-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v05009020-1">20 </span> And the <span class="nd">LORD</span> was very angry with Aaron to have destroyed him: and I prayed for Aaron also the same time.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt05009021-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v05009021-1">21 </span> And I took your sin, the calf which ye had made, and burnt it with fire, and stamped it, <span class="add">and</span> ground <span class="add">it</span> very small, <span class="add">even</span> until it was as small as dust: and I cast the dust thereof into the brook that descended out of the mount.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt05009022-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v05009022-1">22 </span> And at Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibroth-hattaavah, ye provoked the <span class="nd">LORD</span> to wrath.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt05009023-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v05009023-1">23 </span> Likewise when the <span class="nd">LORD</span> sent you from Kadesh-barnea, saying, Go up and possess the land which I have given you; then ye rebelled against the commandment of the <span class="nd">LORD</span> your God, and ye believed him not, nor hearkened to his voice.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt05009024-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v05009024-1">24 </span> Ye have been rebellious against the <span class="nd">LORD</span> from the day that I knew you.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt05009025-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v05009025-1">25 </span> Thus I fell down before the <span class="nd">LORD</span> forty days and forty nights, as I fell down <span class="add">at the first;</span> because the <span class="nd">LORD</span> had said he would destroy you.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt05009026-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v05009026-1">26 </span> I prayed therefore unto the <span class="nd">LORD</span>, and said, O Lord <span class="nd">GOD</span>, destroy not thy people and thine inheritance, which thou hast redeemed through thy greatness, which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt05009027-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v05009027-1">27 </span> Remember thy servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; look not unto the stubbornness of this people, nor to their wickedness, nor to their sin:  </span><span class="verse" id="vt05009028-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v05009028-1">28 </span> Lest the land whence thou broughtest us out say, Because the <span class="nd">LORD</span> was not able to bring them into the land which he promised them, and because he hated them, he hath brought them out to slay them in the wilderness.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt05009029-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v05009029-1">29 </span>Yet they <span class="add">are</span> thy people and thine inheritance, which thou broughtest out by thy mighty power and by thy stretched out arm. </span></p>
