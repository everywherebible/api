 </span><span class="verse" id="vt58009015-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v58009015-1">15 </span> And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions <span class="add">that were</span> under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt58009016-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v58009016-1">16 </span> For where a testament <span class="add">is</span>, there must also of necessity be the death of the testator.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt58009017-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v58009017-1">17 </span> For a testament <span class="add">is</span> of force after men are dead: otherwise it is of no strength  at all while the testator liveth.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt58009018-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v58009018-1">18 </span> Whereupon neither the first <span class="add">testament</span> was dedicated without blood.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt58009019-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v58009019-1">19 </span> For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of calves and of goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book, and all the people,  </span><span class="verse" id="vt58009020-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v58009020-1">20 </span> Saying, This <span class="add">is</span> the blood of the testament which God hath enjoined unto you.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt58009021-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v58009021-1">21 </span> Moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle, and all the vessels of the ministry.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt58009022-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v58009022-1">22 </span> And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt58009023-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v58009023-1">23 </span> <span class="add">It was</span> therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt58009024-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v58009024-1">24 </span> For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, <span class="add">which are</span> the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us:  </span><span class="verse" id="vt58009025-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v58009025-1">25 </span> Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others;  </span><span class="verse" id="vt58009026-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v58009026-1">26 </span> For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt58009027-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v58009027-1">27 </span> And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment:  </span><span class="verse" id="vt58009028-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v58009028-1">28 </span> So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation. </span></p>
