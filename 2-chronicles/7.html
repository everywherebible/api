and the glory of the <span class="nd">LORD</span> filled the house.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt14007002-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v14007002-1">2 </span> And the priests could not enter into the house of the <span class="nd">LORD</span>, because the glory of the <span class="nd">LORD</span> had filled the <span class="nd">LORD’s</span> house.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt14007003-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v14007003-1">3 </span> And when all the children of Israel saw how the fire came down, and the glory of the <span class="nd">LORD</span> upon the house, they bowed themselves with their faces to the ground upon the pavement, and worshipped, and praised the <span class="nd">LORD</span>, <span class="add">saying</span>, For <span class="add">he is</span> good;
