But Jonah was gone down into the sides of the ship; and he lay, and was fast asleep.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt32001006-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v32001006-1">6 </span> So the shipmaster came to him, and said unto him, What meanest thou, O sleeper? arise, call upon thy God, if so be that God will think upon us, that we perish not.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt32001007-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v32001007-1">7 </span> And they said every one to his fellow, Come, and let us cast lots, that we may know for whose cause this evil <span class="add">is</span> upon us. So they cast lots, and the lot fell upon Jonah.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt32001008-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v32001008-1">8 </span> Then said they unto him, Tell us, we pray thee, for whose cause this evil <span class="add">is</span> upon us; What <span class="add">is</span> thine occupation? and whence comest thou? what <span class="add">is</span> thy country? and of what people <span class="add">art</span> thou?  </span><span class="verse" id="vt32001009-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v32001009-1">9 </span> And he said unto them, I <span class="add">am</span> an Hebrew; and I fear the <span class="nd">LORD</span>, the God of heaven, which hath made the sea and the dry <span class="add">land</span>.<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§</a>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt32001010-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v32001010-1">10 </span> Then were the men exceedingly afraid, and said unto him, Why hast thou done this?
