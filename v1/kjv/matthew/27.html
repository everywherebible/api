Barabbas, or Jesus which is called Christ?  </span><span class="verse" id="vt40027018-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v40027018-1">18 </span> For he knew that for envy they had delivered him. </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt40027019-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v40027019-1">19 </span>¶ When he was set down on the judgment seat, his wife sent unto him, saying, Have thou nothing to do with that just man: for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt40027020-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v40027020-1">20 </span> But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that they should ask Barabbas, and destroy Jesus.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt40027021-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v40027021-1">21 </span> The governor answered and said unto them, Whether of the twain will ye that I release unto you?

Then Pilate commanded the body to be delivered.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt40027059-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v40027059-1">59 </span> And when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,  </span><span class="verse" id="vt40027060-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v40027060-1">60 </span> And laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock: and he rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre, and departed.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt40027061-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v40027061-1">61 </span> And there was Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, sitting over against the sepulchre. </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt40027062-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v40027062-1">62 </span>¶ Now the next day, that followed the day of the preparation, the chief priests and Pharisees came together unto Pilate,  </span><span class="verse" id="vt40027063-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v40027063-1">63 </span> Saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while he was yet alive, After three days I will rise again.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt40027064-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v40027064-1">64 </span> Command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the third day, lest his disciples come by night, and steal him away, and say unto the people, He is risen from the dead: so the last error shall be worse than the first.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt40027065-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v40027065-1">65 </span> Pilate said unto them, Ye have a watch: go your way, make <span class="add">it</span> as sure as ye can.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt40027066-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v40027066-1">66 </span> So they went, and made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone, and setting a watch. </span></p>
