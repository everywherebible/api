<p> <span class="verse" id="vt40025001-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v40025001-1">1 </span> <span class="woc"> Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom.</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt40025002-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v40025002-1">2 </span> <span class="woc"> And five of them were wise, and five <span class="add">were</span> foolish.</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt40025003-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v40025003-1">3 </span> <span class="woc"> They that <span class="add">were</span> foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them:</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt40025004-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v40025004-1">4 </span> <span class="woc"> But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt40025005-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v40025005-1">5 </span> <span class="woc"> While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept.</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt40025006-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v40025006-1">6 </span> <span class="woc"> And at midnight  there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him.</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt40025007-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v40025007-1">7 </span> <span class="woc"> Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt40025008-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v40025008-1">8 </span> <span class="woc"> And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are gone out.</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt40025009-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v40025009-1">9 </span> <span class="woc"> But the wise answered, saying, <span class="add">Not so</span>; lest there be not enough for us and you: but go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves.</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt40025010-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v40025010-1">10 </span> <span class="woc"> And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage: and the door was shut.</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt40025011-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v40025011-1">11 </span> <span class="woc"> Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us.</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt40025012-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v40025012-1">12 </span> <span class="woc"> But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not.</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt40025013-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v40025013-1">13 </span> <span class="woc"> Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh.</span> </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt40025014-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v40025014-1">14 </span> <span class="woc">¶ For <span class="add">the kingdom of heaven is</span> as a man travelling into a far country, <span class="add">who</span> called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods.</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt40025015-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v40025015-1">15 </span> <span class="woc"> And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to every man according to his several ability; and straightway took his journey.</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt40025016-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v40025016-1">16 </span> <span class="woc"> Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same, and made <span class="add">them</span> other five talents.</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt40025017-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v40025017-1">17 </span> <span class="woc"> And likewise he that <span class="add">had received</span> two, he also gained other two.</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt40025018-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v40025018-1">18 </span> <span class="woc"> But he that had received one went and digged in the earth, and hid his lord’s money.</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt40025019-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v40025019-1">19 </span> <span class="woc"> After a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and reckoneth with them.</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt40025020-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v40025020-1">20 </span> <span class="woc"> And so he that had received five talents came and brought other five talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me five talents: behold, I have gained beside them five talents more.</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt40025021-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v40025021-1">21 </span> <span class="woc"> His lord said unto him, Well done, <span class="add">thou</span> good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt40025022-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v40025022-1">22 </span> <span class="woc"> He also that had received two talents came and said, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me two talents: behold, I have gained two other talents beside them.</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt40025023-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v40025023-1">23 </span> <span class="woc"> His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt40025024-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v40025024-1">24 </span> <span class="woc"> Then he which had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew thee that thou art an hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown, and gathering where thou hast not strawed:</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt40025025-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v40025025-1">25 </span> <span class="woc"> And I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth: lo, <span class="add">there</span> thou hast <span class="add">that is</span> thine.</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt40025026-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v40025026-1">26 </span> <span class="woc"> His lord answered and said unto him, <span class="add">Thou</span> wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I have not strawed:</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt40025027-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v40025027-1">27 </span> <span class="woc"> Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers, and <span class="add">then</span> at my coming I should have received mine own with usury.</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt40025028-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v40025028-1">28 </span> <span class="woc"> Take therefore the talent from him, and give <span class="add">it</span> unto him which hath ten talents.</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt40025029-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v40025029-1">29 </span> <span class="woc"> For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath.</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt40025030-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v40025030-1">30 </span> <span class="woc"> And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</span> </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt40025031-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v40025031-1">31 </span> <span class="woc">¶ When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory:</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt40025032-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v40025032-1">32 </span> <span class="woc"> And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth <span class="add">his</span> sheep from the goats:</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt40025033-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v40025033-1">33 </span> <span class="woc"> And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt40025034-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v40025034-1">34 </span> <span class="woc"> Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt40025035-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v40025035-1">35 </span> <span class="woc"> For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in:</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt40025036-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v40025036-1">36 </span> <span class="woc"> Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me.</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt40025037-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v40025037-1">37 </span> <span class="woc"> Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, and fed <span class="add">thee</span>? or thirsty, and gave thee drink?</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt40025038-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v40025038-1">38 </span> <span class="woc"> When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed <span class="add">thee</span>?</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt40025039-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v40025039-1">39 </span> <span class="woc"> Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt40025040-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v40025040-1">40 </span> <span class="woc"> And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done <span class="add">it</span> unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done <span class="add">it</span> unto me.</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt40025041-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v40025041-1">41 </span> <span class="woc"> Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels:</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt40025042-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v40025042-1">42 </span> <span class="woc"> For I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink:</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt40025043-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v40025043-1">43 </span> <span class="woc"> I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed me

him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee?</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt40025045-1"><span
