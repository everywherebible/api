And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, the priests of the <span class="nd">LORD</span>, <span class="add">were</span> there.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*</a> </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt09001004-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v09001004-1">4 </span>¶ And when the time was that Elkanah offered, he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions:  </span><span class="verse" id="vt09001005-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v09001005-1">5 </span> But unto Hannah he gave a worthy portion; for he loved Hannah: but the <span class="nd">LORD</span> had shut up her womb.<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†</a>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt09001006-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v09001006-1">6 </span> And her adversary also provoked her sore, for to make her fret, because the <span class="nd">LORD</span> had shut up her womb.<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡</a>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt09001007-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v09001007-1">7 </span>And <span class="add">as</span> he did so year by year, when she went up to the house of the <span class="nd">LORD</span>, so she provoked her; therefore she wept, and did not eat.<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§</a>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt09001008-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v09001008-1">8 </span> Then said Elkanah her husband to her, Hannah, why weepest thou? and why eatest thou not? and why is thy heart grieved? <span class="add">am</span> not I better to thee than ten sons? </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt09001009-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v09001009-1">9 </span>¶ So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunk.

So the woman went her way, and did eat, and her countenance was no more <span class="add">sad</span>. </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt09001019-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v09001019-1">19 </span>¶ And they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before the <span class="nd">LORD</span>, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah: and Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and the <span class="nd">LORD</span> remembered her.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt09001020-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v09001020-1">20 </span> Wherefore it came to pass, when the time was come about after Hannah had conceived, that she bare a son, and called his name Samuel, <span class="add">saying</span>, Because I have asked him of the <span class="nd">LORD</span>.<a href="#FN10" class="notemark">†††</a><a href="#FN11" class="notemark">‡‡‡</a>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt09001021-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v09001021-1">21 </span> And the man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer unto the <span class="nd">LORD</span> the yearly sacrifice, and his vow.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt09001022-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v09001022-1">22 </span> But Hannah went not up; for she said unto her husband, <span class="add">I will not go up</span> until the child be weaned, and <span class="add">then</span> I will bring him, that he may appear before the <span class="nd">LORD</span>, and there abide for ever.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt09001023-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v09001023-1">23 </span> And Elkanah her husband said unto her, Do what seemeth thee good; tarry until thou have weaned him; only the <span class="nd">LORD</span> establish his word. So the woman abode, and gave her son suck until she weaned him. </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt09001024-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v09001024-1">24 </span>¶ And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three bullocks, and one ephah of flour, and a bottle of wine, and brought him unto the house of the <span class="nd">LORD</span> in Shiloh: and the child <span class="add">was</span> young.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt09001025-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v09001025-1">25 </span> And they slew a bullock, and brought the child to Eli.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt09001026-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v09001026-1">26 </span> And she said, Oh my lord, <span class="add">as</span> thy soul liveth, my lord, I <span class="add">am</span> the woman that stood by thee here, praying unto the <span class="nd">LORD</span>.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt09001027-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v09001027-1">27 </span> For this child I prayed; and the <span class="nd">LORD</span> hath given me my petition which I asked of him:  </span><span class="verse" id="vt09001028-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v09001028-1">28 </span> Therefore also I have lent him to the <span class="nd">LORD</span>; as long as he liveth he shall be lent to the <span class="nd">LORD</span>.
