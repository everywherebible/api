<p> <span class="verse" id="vt47005001-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v47005001-1">1 </span> For we know that if our earthly house of <span class="add">this</span> tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt47005002-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v47005002-1">2 </span> For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven:  </span><span class="verse" id="vt47005003-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v47005003-1">3 </span> If so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt47005004-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v47005004-1">4 </span> For we that are in <span class="add">this</span> tabernacle do groan, being burdened: not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality might be swallowed up of life.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt47005005-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v47005005-1">5 </span> Now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing <span class="add">is</span> God, who also hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt47005006-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v47005006-1">6 </span> Therefore <span class="add">we are</span> always confident, knowing that, whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord:  </span><span class="verse" id="vt47005007-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v47005007-1">7 </span>(For we walk by faith, not by sight:)  </span><span class="verse" id="vt47005008-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v47005008-1">8 </span> We are confident, <span class="add">I say</span>, and willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt47005009-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v47005009-1">9 </span> Wherefore we labour, that, whether present or absent, we may be accepted of him.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt47005010-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v47005010-1">10 </span> For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things <span class="add">done</span> in <span class="add">his</span> body, according to that he hath done, whether <span class="add">it be</span> good or bad. </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt47005011-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v47005011-1">11 </span> Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men; but we are made manifest unto God; and I trust also are made manifest in your consciences.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt47005012-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v47005012-1">12 </span> For we commend not ourselves again unto you, but give you occasion to glory on our behalf, that ye may have somewhat to <span class="add">answer</span> them which glory in appearance, and not in heart.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt47005013-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v47005013-1">13 </span> For whether we be beside ourselves, <span class="add">it is</span> to God: or whether we be sober, <span class="add">it is</span> for your cause.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt47005014-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v47005014-1">14 </span> For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead:  </span><span class="verse" id="vt47005015-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v47005015-1">15 </span> And <span class="add">that</span> he died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose again.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt47005016-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v47005016-1">16 </span> Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh: yea, though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we <span class="add">him</span> no more.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt47005017-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v47005017-1">17 </span> Therefore if any man <span class="add">be</span> in Christ, <span class="add">he is</span> a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt47005018-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v47005018-1">18 </span> And all things <span class="add">are</span> of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation;  </span><span class="verse" id="vt47005019-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v47005019-1">19 </span> To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt47005020-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v47005020-1">20 </span> Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech <span class="add">you</span> by us: we pray <span class="add">you</span> in Christ’s stead, be ye reconciled to God.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt47005021-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v47005021-1">21 </span> For he hath made him <span class="add">to be</span> sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him. </span></p>
