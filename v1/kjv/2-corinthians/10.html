If any man trust to himself that he is Christ’s, let him of himself think this again, that, as he <span class="add">is</span> Christ’s, even so <span class="add">are</span> we Christ’s.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt47010008-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v47010008-1">8 </span> For though I should boast somewhat more of our authority, which the Lord hath given us for edification, and not for your destruction, I should not be ashamed:  </span><span class="verse" id="vt47010009-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v47010009-1">9 </span> That I may not seem as if I would terrify you by letters.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt47010010-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v47010010-1">10 </span> For <span class="add">his</span> letters, say they, <span class="add">are</span> weighty and powerful; but <span class="add">his</span> bodily presence <span class="add">is</span> weak, and <span class="add">his</span> speech contemptible.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt47010011-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v47010011-1">11 </span> Let such an one think this, that, such as we are in word by letters when we are absent, such <span class="add">will we be</span> also in deed when we are present.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt47010012-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v47010012-1">12 </span> For we dare not make ourselves of the number, or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves: but they measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves among themselves, are not wise.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt47010013-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v47010013-1">13 </span> But we will not boast of things without <span class="add">our</span> measure, but according to the measure of the rule which God hath distributed to us, a measure to reach even unto you.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt47010014-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v47010014-1">14 </span> For we stretch not ourselves beyond <span class="add">our measure</span>, as though we reached not unto you: for we are come as far as to you also in <span class="add">preaching</span> the gospel of Christ:  </span><span class="verse" id="vt47010015-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v47010015-1">15 </span> Not boasting of things without <span class="add">our</span> measure, <span class="add">that is</span>, of other men’s labours; but having hope, when your faith is increased, that we shall be enlarged by you according to our rule abundantly,  </span><span class="verse" id="vt47010016-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v47010016-1">16 </span> To preach the gospel in the <span class="add">regions</span> beyond you, <span class="add">and</span> not to boast in another man’s line of things made ready to our hand.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt47010017-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v47010017-1">17 </span> But he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt47010018-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v47010018-1">18 </span> For not he that commendeth himself is approved, but whom the Lord commendeth. </span></p>
