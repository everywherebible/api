And who <span class="add">is</span> sufficient for these things?  </span><span class="verse" id="vt47002017-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v47002017-1">17 </span> For we are not as many, which corrupt the word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God speak we in Christ. </span></p>
