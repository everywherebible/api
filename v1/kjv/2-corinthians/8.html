<p> <span class="verse" id="vt47008001-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v47008001-1">1 </span> Moreover, brethren, we do you to wit of the grace of God bestowed on the churches of Macedonia;  </span><span class="verse" id="vt47008002-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v47008002-1">2 </span> How that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt47008003-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v47008003-1">3 </span> For to <span class="add">their</span> power, I bear record, yea, and beyond <span class="add">their</span> power <span class="add">they were</span> willing of themselves;  </span><span class="verse" id="vt47008004-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v47008004-1">4 </span> Praying us with much intreaty that we would receive the gift, and <span class="add">take upon us</span> the fellowship of the ministering to the saints.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt47008005-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v47008005-1">5 </span> And <span class="add">this they did</span>, not as we hoped, but first gave their own selves to the Lord, and unto us by the will of God.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt47008006-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v47008006-1">6 </span> Insomuch that we desired Titus, that as he had begun, so he would also finish in you the same grace also.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt47008007-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v47008007-1">7 </span> Therefore, as ye abound in every <span class="add">thing, in</span> faith, and utterance, and knowledge, and <span class="add">in</span> all diligence, and <span class="add">in</span> your love to us, <span class="add">see</span> that ye abound in this grace also.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt47008008-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v47008008-1">8 </span> I speak not by commandment, but by occasion of the forwardness of others, and to prove the sincerity of your love.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt47008009-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v47008009-1">9 </span> For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt47008010-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v47008010-1">10 </span> And herein I give <span class="add">my</span> advice: for this is expedient for you, who have begun before, not only to do, but also to be forward a year ago.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt47008011-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v47008011-1">11 </span> Now therefore perform the doing <span class="add">of it</span>; that as <span class="add">there was</span> a readiness to will, so <span class="add">there may be</span> a performance also out of that which ye have.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt47008012-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v47008012-1">12 </span> For if there be first a willing mind, <span class="add">it is</span> accepted according to that a man hath, <span class="add">and</span> not according to that he hath not.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt47008013-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v47008013-1">13 </span> For <span class="add">I mean</span> not that other men be eased, and ye burdened:  </span><span class="verse" id="vt47008014-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v47008014-1">14 </span>But by an equality, <span class="add">that</span> now at this time your abundance <span class="add">may be a supply</span> for their want, that their abundance also may be <span class="add">a supply</span> for your want: that there may be equality:  </span><span class="verse" id="vt47008015-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v47008015-1">15 </span> As it is written, He that <span class="add">had gathered</span> much had nothing over; and he that <span class="add">had gathered</span> little had no lack.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt47008016-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v47008016-1">16 </span> But thanks <span class="add">be</span> to God, which put the same earnest care into the heart of Titus for you.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt47008017-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v47008017-1">17 </span> For indeed he accepted the exhortation; but being more forward, of his own accord he went unto you.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt47008018-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v47008018-1">18 </span> And we have sent with him the brother, whose praise <span class="add">is</span> in the gospel throughout all the churches;  </span><span class="verse" id="vt47008019-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v47008019-1">19 </span> And not <span class="add">that</span> only, but who was also chosen of the churches to travel with us with this grace, which is administered by us to the glory of the same Lord, and <span class="add">declaration of</span> your ready mind:  </span><span class="verse" id="vt47008020-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v47008020-1">20 </span> Avoiding this, that no man should blame us in this abundance which is administered by us:  </span><span class="verse" id="vt47008021-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v47008021-1">21 </span> Providing for honest things, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt47008022-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v47008022-1">22 </span> And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have oftentimes proved diligent in many things, but now much more diligent, upon the great confidence which <span class="add">I have</span> in you.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt47008023-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v47008023-1">23 </span> Whether <span class="add">any do enquire</span> of Titus, <span class="add">he is</span> my partner and fellowhelper concerning you: or our brethren <span class="add">be enquired of, they are</span> the messengers of the churches, <span class="add">and</span> the glory of Christ.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt47008024-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v47008024-1">24 </span> Wherefore shew ye to them, and before the churches, the proof of your love, and of our boasting on your behalf. </span></p>
