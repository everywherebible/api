<p> <span class="verse" id="vt10012001-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v10012001-1">1 </span> And the <span class="nd">LORD</span> sent Nathan unto David. And he came unto him, and said unto him, There were two men in one city; the one rich, and the other poor.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt10012002-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v10012002-1">2 </span> The rich <span class="add">man</span> had exceeding many flocks and herds:  </span><span class="verse" id="vt10012003-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v10012003-1">3 </span> But the poor <span class="add">man</span> had nothing, save one little ewe lamb, which he had bought and nourished up: and it grew up together with him, and with his children; it did eat of his own meat, and drank of his own cup, and lay in his bosom, and was unto him as a daughter.<a href="#FN1" class="footnote">*</a>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt10012004-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v10012004-1">4 </span> And there came a traveller unto the rich man, and he spared to take of his own flock and of his own herd, to dress for the wayfaring man that was come unto him; but took the poor man’s lamb, and dressed it for the man that was come to him.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt10012005-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v10012005-1">5 </span> And David’s anger was greatly kindled against the man; and he said to Nathan, <span class="add">As</span> the <span class="nd">LORD</span> liveth, the man that hath done this <span class="add">thing</span> shall surely die:<a href="#FN2" class="footnote">†</a>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt10012006-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v10012006-1">6 </span> And he shall restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing, and because he had no pity. </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt10012007-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v10012007-1">7 </span>¶ And Nathan said to David, Thou <span class="add">art</span> the man. Thus saith the <span class="nd">LORD</span> God of Israel, I anointed thee king over Israel, and I delivered thee out of the hand of Saul;  </span><span class="verse" id="vt10012008-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v10012008-1">8 </span> And I gave thee thy master’s house, and thy master’s wives into thy bosom, and gave thee the house of Israel and of Judah; and if <span class="add">that had been</span> too little, I would moreover have given unto thee such and such things.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt10012009-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v10012009-1">9 </span> Wherefore hast thou despised the commandment of the <span class="nd">LORD</span>, to do evil in his sight? thou hast killed Uriah the Hittite with the sword, and hast taken his wife <span class="add">to be</span> thy wife, and hast slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt10012010-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v10012010-1">10 </span> Now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house; because thou hast despised me, and hast taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be thy wife.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt10012011-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v10012011-1">11 </span> Thus saith the <span class="nd">LORD</span>, Behold, I will raise up evil against thee out of thine own house, and I will take thy wives before thine eyes, and give <span class="add">them</span> unto thy neighbour, and he shall lie with thy wives in the sight of this sun.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt10012012-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v10012012-1">12 </span> For thou didst <span class="add">it</span> secretly: but I will do this thing before all Israel, and before the sun.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt10012013-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v10012013-1">13 </span> And David said unto Nathan, I have sinned against the <span class="nd">LORD</span>. And Nathan said unto David, The <span class="nd">LORD</span> also hath put away thy sin; thou shalt not die.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt10012014-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v10012014-1">14 </span> Howbeit, because by this deed thou hast given great occasion to the enemies of the <span class="nd">LORD</span> to blaspheme, the child also <span class="add">that is</span> born unto thee shall surely die. </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt10012015-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v10012015-1">15 </span>¶ And Nathan departed unto his house. And the <span class="nd">LORD</span> struck the child that Uriah’s wife bare unto David, and it was very sick.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt10012016-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v10012016-1">16 </span> David therefore besought God for the child; and David fasted, and went in, and lay all night upon the earth.<a href="#FN3" class="footnote">‡</a>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt10012017-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v10012017-1">17 </span> And the elders of his house arose, <span class="add">and went</span> to him, to raise him up from the earth: but he would not, neither did he eat bread with them.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt10012018-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v10012018-1">18 </span> And it came to pass on the seventh day, that the child died. And the servants of David feared to tell him that the child was dead: for they said, Behold, while the child was yet alive, we spake unto him, and he would not hearken unto our voice: how will he then vex himself, if we tell him that the child is dead?<a href="#FN4" class="footnote">§</a>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt10012019-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v10012019-1">19 </span> But when David saw that his servants whispered, David perceived that the child was dead: therefore David said unto his servants, Is the child dead? And they said, He is dead.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt10012020-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v10012020-1">20 </span> Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed <span class="add">himself</span>, and changed his apparel, and came into the house of the <span class="nd">LORD</span>, and worshipped: then he came to his own house; and when he required, they set bread before him, and he did eat.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt10012021-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v10012021-1">21 </span> Then said his servants unto him, What thing <span class="add">is</span> this that thou hast done? thou didst fast and weep for the child, <span class="add">while it was</span> alive; but when the child was dead, thou didst rise and eat bread.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt10012022-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v10012022-1">22 </span> And he said, While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept: for I said, Who can tell <span class="add">whether</span> <span class="nd">GOD</span> will be gracious to me, that the child may live?  </span><span class="verse" id="vt10012023-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v10012023-1">23 </span> But now he is dead, wherefore should I fast? can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he shall not return to me. </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt10012024-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v10012024-1">24 </span>¶ And David comforted Bath-sheba his wife, and went in unto her, and lay with her: and she bare a son, and he called his name Solomon: and the <span class="nd">LORD</span> loved him.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt10012025-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v10012025-1">25 </span> And he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet; and he called his name Jedidiah, because of the <span class="nd">LORD</span>.<a href="#FN5" class="footnote">**</a> </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt10012026-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v10012026-1">26 </span>¶ And Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and took the royal city.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt10012027-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v10012027-1">27 </span> And Joab sent messengers to David, and said, I have fought against Rabbah, and have taken the city of waters.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt10012028-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v10012028-1">28 </span> Now therefore gather the rest of the people together, and encamp against the city, and take it: lest I take the city, and it be called after my name.<a href="#FN6" class="footnote">††</a>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt10012029-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v10012029-1">29 </span> And David gathered all the people together, and went to Rabbah, and fought against it, and took it.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt10012030-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v10012030-1">30 </span> And he took their king’s crown from off his head, the weight whereof <span class="add">was</span> a talent of gold with the precious stones: and it was <span class="add">set</span> on David’s head. And he brought forth the spoil of the city in great abundance.<a href="#FN7" class="footnote">‡‡</a>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt10012031-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v10012031-1">31 </span> And he brought forth the people that <span class="add">were</span> therein, and put <span class="add">them</span> under saws, and under harrows of iron, and under axes of iron, and made them pass through the brickkiln: and thus did he unto all the cities of the children of Ammon. So David and all the people returned unto Jerusalem. </span></p>
