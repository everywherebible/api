And he said, Thy servant <span class="add">is</span> of one of the tribes of Israel.<a href="#FN1" class="footnote">*</a>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt10015003-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v10015003-1">3 </span> And Absalom said unto him, See, thy matters <span class="add">are</span> good and right; but <span class="add">there is</span> no man <span class="add">deputed</span> of the king to hear thee.<a href="#FN2" class="footnote">†</a>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt10015004-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v10015004-1">4 </span> Absalom said moreover, Oh that I were made judge in the land, that every man which hath any suit or cause might come unto me, and I would do him justice!  </span><span class="verse" id="vt10015005-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v10015005-1">5 </span>And it was <span class="add">so</span>, that when any man came nigh <span class="add">to him</span> to do him obeisance, he put forth his hand, and took him, and kissed him.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt10015006-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v10015006-1">6 </span> And on this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the king for judgment: so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel. </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt10015007-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v10015007-1">7 </span>¶ And it came to pass after forty years, that Absalom said unto the king, I pray thee, let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed unto the <span class="nd">LORD</span>, in Hebron.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt10015008-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v10015008-1">8 </span> For thy servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Syria, saying, If the <span class="nd">LORD</span> shall bring me again indeed to Jerusalem, then I will serve the <span class="nd">LORD</span>.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt10015009-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v10015009-1">9 </span> And the king said unto him, Go in peace.
