<p> <span class="verse" id="vt10018001-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v10018001-1">1 </span> And David numbered the people that <span class="add">were</span> with him, and set captains of thousands and captains of hundreds over them.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt10018002-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v10018002-1">2 </span> And David sent forth a third part of the people under the hand of Joab, and a third part under the hand of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab’s brother, and a third part under the hand of Ittai the Gittite. And the king said unto the people, I will surely go forth with you myself also.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt10018003-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v10018003-1">3 </span> But the people answered, Thou shalt not go forth: for if we flee away, they will not care for us; neither if half of us die, will they care for us: but now <span class="add">thou art</span> worth ten thousand of us: therefore now <span class="add">it is</span> better that thou succour us out of the city.<a href="#FN1" class="footnote">*</a><a href="#FN2" class="footnote">†</a><a href="#FN3" class="footnote">‡</a>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt10018004-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v10018004-1">4 </span> And the king said unto them, What seemeth you best I will do. And the king stood by the gate side, and all the people came out by hundreds and by thousands.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt10018005-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v10018005-1">5 </span> And the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, <span class="add">Deal</span> gently for my sake with the young man, <span class="add">even</span> with Absalom. And all the people heard when the king gave all the captains charge concerning Absalom. </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt10018006-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v10018006-1">6 </span>¶ So the people went out into the field against  Israel: and the battle was in the wood of Ephraim;  </span><span class="verse" id="vt10018007-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v10018007-1">7 </span> Where the people of Israel were slain before the servants of David, and there was there a great slaughter that day of twenty thousand <span class="add">men</span>.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt10018008-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v10018008-1">8 </span> For the battle was there scattered over the face of all the country: and the wood devoured more people that day than the sword devoured.<a href="#FN4" class="footnote">§</a> </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt10018009-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v10018009-1">9 </span>¶ And Absalom met the servants of David. And Absalom rode upon a mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak, and his head caught hold of the oak, and he was taken up between the heaven and the earth; and the mule that <span class="add">was</span> under him went away.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt10018010-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v10018010-1">10 </span> And a certain man saw <span class="add">it</span>, and told Joab, and said, Behold, I saw Absalom hanged in an oak.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt10018011-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v10018011-1">11 </span> And Joab said unto the man that told him, And, behold, thou sawest <span class="add">him</span>, and why didst thou not smite him there to the ground? and I would have given thee ten <span class="add">shekels</span> of silver, and a girdle.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt10018012-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v10018012-1">12 </span> And the man said unto Joab, Though I should receive a thousand <span class="add">shekels</span> of silver in mine hand, <span class="add">yet</span> would I not put forth mine hand against the king’s son: for in our hearing the king charged thee and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Beware that none <span class="add">touch</span> the young man Absalom.<a href="#FN5" class="footnote">**</a><a href="#FN6" class="footnote">††</a>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt10018013-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v10018013-1">13 </span> Otherwise I should have wrought falsehood against mine own life: for there is no matter hid from the king, and thou thyself wouldest have set thyself against <span class="add">me</span>.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt10018014-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v10018014-1">14 </span> Then said Joab, I may not tarry thus with thee. And he took three darts in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of Absalom, while he <span class="add">was</span> yet alive in the midst of the oak.<a href="#FN7" class="footnote">‡‡</a><a href="#FN8" class="footnote">§§</a>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt10018015-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v10018015-1">15 </span> And ten young men that bare Joab’s armour compassed about and smote Absalom, and slew him.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt10018016-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v10018016-1">16 </span> And Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing after Israel: for Joab held back the people.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt10018017-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v10018017-1">17 </span> And they took Absalom, and cast him into a great pit in the wood, and laid a very great heap of stones upon him: and all Israel fled every one to his tent. </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt10018018-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v10018018-1">18 </span>¶ Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself a pillar, which <span class="add">is</span> in the king’s dale: for he said, I have no son to keep my name in remembrance: and he called the pillar after his own name: and it is called unto this day, Absalom’s place. </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt10018019-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v10018019-1">19 </span>¶ Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok, Let me now run, and bear the king tidings, how that the <span class="nd">LORD</span> hath avenged him of his enemies.<a href="#FN9" class="footnote">***</a>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt10018020-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v10018020-1">20 </span> And Joab said unto him, Thou shalt not bear tidings this day, but thou shalt bear tidings another day: but this day thou shalt bear no tidings, because the king’s son is dead.<a href="#FN10" class="footnote">†††</a>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt10018021-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v10018021-1">21 </span> Then said Joab to Cushi, Go tell the king what thou hast seen. And Cushi bowed himself unto Joab, and ran.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt10018022-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v10018022-1">22 </span> Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok yet again to Joab, But howsoever, let me, I pray thee, also run after Cushi. And Joab said, Wherefore wilt thou run, my son, seeing that thou hast no tidings ready?<a href="#FN11" class="footnote">‡‡‡</a><a href="#FN12" class="footnote">§§§</a>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt10018023-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v10018023-1">23 </span>But howsoever, <span class="add">said he</span>, let me run. And he said unto him, Run. Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain, and overran Cushi.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt10018024-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v10018024-1">24 </span> And David sat between the two gates: and the watchman went up to the roof over the gate unto the wall, and lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold a man running alone.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt10018025-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v10018025-1">25 </span> And the watchman cried, and told the king. And the king said, If he <span class="add">be</span> alone, <span class="add">there is</span> tidings in his mouth. And he came apace, and drew near.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt10018026-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v10018026-1">26 </span> And the watchman saw another man running: and the watchman called unto the porter, and said, Behold <span class="add">another</span> man running alone. And the king said, He also bringeth tidings.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt10018027-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v10018027-1">27 </span> And the watchman said, Me thinketh the running of the foremost is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok. And the king said, He <span class="add">is</span> a good man, and cometh with good tidings.<a href="#FN13" class="footnote">*</a>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt10018028-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v10018028-1">28 </span> And Ahimaaz called, and said unto the king, All is well. And he fell down to the earth upon his face before the king, and said, Blessed <span class="add">be</span> the <span class="nd">LORD</span> thy God, which hath delivered up the men that lifted up their hand against my lord the king.<a href="#FN14" class="footnote">†</a><a href="#FN15" class="footnote">‡</a>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt10018029-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v10018029-1">29 </span> And the king said, Is the young man Absalom safe? And Ahimaaz answered, When Joab sent the king’s servant, and <span class="add">me</span> thy servant, I saw a great tumult, but I knew not what <span class="add">it was</span>.<a href="#FN16" class="footnote">§</a>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt10018030-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v10018030-1">30 </span> And the king said <span class="add">unto him</span>, Turn aside, <span class="add">and</span> stand here. And he turned aside, and stood still.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt10018031-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v10018031-1">31 </span> And, behold, Cushi came; and Cushi said, Tidings, my lord the king: for the <span class="nd">LORD</span> hath avenged thee this day of all them that rose up against thee.<a href="#FN17" class="footnote">**</a>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt10018032-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v10018032-1">32 </span> And the king said unto Cushi, Is the young man Absalom safe? And Cushi answered, The enemies of my lord the king, and all that rise against thee to do <span class="add">thee</span> hurt, be as <span class="add">that</span> young man <span class="add">is</span>. </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt10018033-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v10018033-1">33 </span>¶ And the king was much moved, and went up to the chamber over the gate, and wept: and as he went, thus he said, O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! would God I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son, my son! </span></p>
