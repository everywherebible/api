So all Israel went to their tents.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt14010017-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v14010017-1">17 </span>But <span class="add">as for</span> the children of Israel that dwelt in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt14010018-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v14010018-1">18 </span> Then king Rehoboam sent Hadoram that <span class="add">was</span> over the tribute; and the children of Israel stoned him with stones, that he died.
