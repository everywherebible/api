And her smoke rose up for ever and ever.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt66019004-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v66019004-1">4 </span> And the four and twenty elders and the four beasts fell down and worshipped God that sat on the throne, saying, Amen; Alleluia.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt66019005-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v66019005-1">5 </span> And a voice came out of the throne, saying, Praise our God, all ye his servants, and ye that fear him, both small and great.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt66019006-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v66019006-1">6 </span> And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunderings, saying, Alleluia: for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt66019007-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v66019007-1">7 </span> Let us be glad and rejoice, and give honour to him: for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made herself ready.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt66019008-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v66019008-1">8 </span> And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white: for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt66019009-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v66019009-1">9 </span> And he saith unto me, Write, Blessed <span class="add">are</span> they which are called unto the marriage supper of the Lamb.
