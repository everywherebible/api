I will tell thee the mystery of the woman, and of the beast that carrieth her, which hath the seven heads and ten horns.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt66017008-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v66017008-1">8 </span> The beast that thou sawest was, and is not; and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit, and go into perdition: and they that dwell on the earth shall wonder, whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, when they behold the beast that was, and is not, and yet is.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt66017009-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v66017009-1">9 </span> And here <span class="add">is</span> the mind which hath wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains, on which the woman sitteth.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt66017010-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v66017010-1">10 </span> And there are seven kings: five are fallen, and one is, <span class="add">and</span> the other is not yet come; and when he cometh, he must continue a short space.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt66017011-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v66017011-1">11 </span> And the beast that was, and is not, even he is the eighth, and is of the seven, and goeth into perdition.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt66017012-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v66017012-1">12 </span> And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings, which have received no kingdom as yet; but receive power as kings one hour with the beast.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt66017013-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v66017013-1">13 </span> These have one mind, and shall give their power and strength unto the beast.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt66017014-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v66017014-1">14 </span> These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them: for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings: and they that are with him <span class="add">are</span> called, and chosen, and faithful.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt66017015-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v66017015-1">15 </span> And he saith unto me, The waters which thou sawest, where the whore sitteth, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt66017016-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v66017016-1">16 </span> And the ten horns which thou sawest upon the beast, these shall hate the whore, and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and burn her with fire.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt66017017-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v66017017-1">17 </span> For God hath put in their hearts to fulfil his will, and to agree, and give their kingdom unto the beast, until the words of God shall be fulfilled.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt66017018-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v66017018-1">18 </span> And the woman which thou sawest is that great city, which reigneth over the kings of the earth. </span></p>
