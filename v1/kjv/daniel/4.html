 </span><span class="verse" id="vt27004036-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v27004036-1">36 </span> At the same time my reason returned unto me; and for the glory of my kingdom, mine honour and brightness returned unto me; and my counsellors and my lords sought unto me; and I was established in my kingdom, and excellent majesty was added unto me.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt27004037-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v27004037-1">37 </span> Now I Nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and honour the King of heaven, all whose works <span class="add">are</span> truth, and his ways judgment: and those that walk in pride he is able to abase. </span></p>
