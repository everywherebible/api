<p> <span class="verse" id="vt27008001-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v27008001-1">1 </span> In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision appeared unto me, <span class="add">even unto</span> me Daniel, after that which appeared unto me at the first.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt27008002-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v27008002-1">2 </span> And I saw in a vision; and it came to pass, when I saw, that I <span class="add">was</span> at Shushan <span class="add">in</span> the palace, which <span class="add">is</span> in the province of Elam; and I saw in a vision, and I was by the river of Ulai.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt27008003-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v27008003-1">3 </span> Then I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood before the river a ram which had <span class="add">two</span> horns: and the <span class="add">two</span> horns <span class="add">were</span> high; but one <span class="add">was</span> higher than the other, and the higher came up last.<a href="#FN1" class="footnote">*</a>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt27008004-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v27008004-1">4 </span> I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward; so that no beasts might stand before him, neither <span class="add">was there any</span> that could deliver out of his hand; but he did according to his will, and became great.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt27008005-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v27008005-1">5 </span> And as I was considering, behold, an he goat came from the west on the face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground: and the goat <span class="add">had</span> a notable horn between his eyes.<a href="#FN2" class="footnote">†</a><a href="#FN3" class="footnote">‡</a>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt27008006-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v27008006-1">6 </span> And he came to the ram that had <span class="add">two</span> horns, which I had seen standing before the river, and ran unto him in the fury of his power.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt27008007-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v27008007-1">7 </span> And I saw him come close unto the ram, and he was moved with choler against him, and smote the ram, and brake his two horns: and there was no power in the ram to stand before him, but he cast him down to the ground, and stamped upon him: and there was none that could deliver the ram out of his hand.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt27008008-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v27008008-1">8 </span> Therefore the he goat waxed very great: and when he was strong, the great horn was broken; and for it came up four notable ones toward the four winds of heaven.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt27008009-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v27008009-1">9 </span> And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the pleasant <span class="add">land</span>.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt27008010-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v27008010-1">10 </span> And it waxed great, <span class="add">even</span> to the host of heaven; and it cast down <span class="add">some</span> of the host and of the stars to the ground, and stamped upon them.<a href="#FN4" class="footnote">§</a>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt27008011-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v27008011-1">11 </span> Yea, he magnified <span class="add">himself</span> even to the prince of the host, and by him the daily <span class="add">sacrifice</span> was taken away, and the place of his sanctuary was cast down.<a href="#FN5" class="footnote">**</a><a href="#FN6" class="footnote">††</a>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt27008012-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v27008012-1">12 </span> And an host was given <span class="add">him</span> against the daily <span class="add">sacrifice</span> by reason of transgression, and it cast down the truth to the ground;
