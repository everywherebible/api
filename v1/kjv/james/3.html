If any man offend not in word, the same <span class="add">is</span> a perfect man, <span class="add">and</span> able also to bridle the whole body.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt59003003-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v59003003-1">3 </span> Behold, we put bits in the horses’ mouths, that they may obey us; and we turn about their whole body.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt59003004-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v59003004-1">4 </span> Behold also the ships, which though <span class="add">they be</span> so great, and <span class="add">are</span> driven of fierce winds, yet are they turned about with a very small helm, whithersoever the governor listeth.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt59003005-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v59003005-1">5 </span> Even so the tongue is a little member, and boasteth great things. Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindleth!  </span><span class="verse" id="vt59003006-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v59003006-1">6 </span> And the tongue <span class="add">is</span> a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the tongue among our members, that it defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire of hell.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt59003007-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v59003007-1">7 </span> For every kind of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and of things in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed of mankind:  </span><span class="verse" id="vt59003008-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v59003008-1">8 </span> But the tongue can no man tame; <span class="add">it is</span> an unruly evil, full of deadly poison.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt59003009-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v59003009-1">9 </span> Therewith bless we God, even the Father; and therewith curse we men, which are made after the similitude of God.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt59003010-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v59003010-1">10 </span> Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing.
