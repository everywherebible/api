Do not rich men oppress you, and draw you before the judgment seats?  </span><span class="verse" id="vt59002007-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v59002007-1">7 </span> Do not they blaspheme that worthy name by the which ye are called?  </span><span class="verse" id="vt59002008-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v59002008-1">8 </span> If ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well:  </span><span class="verse" id="vt59002009-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v59002009-1">9 </span> But if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are convinced of the law as transgressors.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt59002010-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v59002010-1">10 </span> For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one <span class="add">point</span>, he is guilty of all.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt59002011-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v59002011-1">11 </span> For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill.
