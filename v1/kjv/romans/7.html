God forbid. Nay, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt45007008-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v45007008-1">8 </span> But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence. For without the law sin <span class="add">was</span> dead.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt45007009-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v45007009-1">9 </span> For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt45007010-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v45007010-1">10 </span> And the commandment, which <span class="add">was ordained</span> to life, I found <span class="add">to be</span> unto death.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt45007011-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v45007011-1">11 </span> For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew <span class="add">me</span>.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt45007012-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v45007012-1">12 </span> Wherefore the law <span class="add">is</span> holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt45007013-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v45007013-1">13 </span> Was then that which is good made death unto me? God forbid. But sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is good; that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt45007014-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v45007014-1">14 </span> For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt45007015-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v45007015-1">15 </span> For that which I do I allow not: for what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt45007016-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v45007016-1">16 </span> If then I do that which I would not, I consent unto the law that <span class="add">it is</span> good.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt45007017-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v45007017-1">17 </span> Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt45007018-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v45007018-1">18 </span> For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with me; but <span class="add">how</span> to perform that which is good I find not.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt45007019-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v45007019-1">19 </span> For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I do.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt45007020-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v45007020-1">20 </span> Now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt45007021-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v45007021-1">21 </span> I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present with me.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt45007022-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v45007022-1">22 </span> For I delight in the law of God after the inward man:  </span><span class="verse" id="vt45007023-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v45007023-1">23 </span> But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt45007024-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v45007024-1">24 </span> O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?  </span><span class="verse" id="vt45007025-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v45007025-1">25 </span> I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin. </span></p>
