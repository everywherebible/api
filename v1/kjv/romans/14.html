Yea, he shall be holden up: for God is able to make him stand.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt45014005-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v45014005-1">5 </span> One man esteemeth one day above another: another esteemeth every day <span class="add">alike</span>. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt45014006-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v45014006-1">6 </span> He that regardeth the day, regardeth <span class="add">it</span> unto the Lord; and he that regardeth not the day, to the Lord he doth not regard <span class="add">it</span>. He that eateth, eateth to the Lord, for he giveth God thanks; and he that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not, and giveth God thanks.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt45014007-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v45014007-1">7 </span> For none of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt45014008-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v45014008-1">8 </span> For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we die, we die unto the Lord: whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord’s.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt45014009-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v45014009-1">9 </span> For to this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and living.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt45014010-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v45014010-1">10 </span> But why dost thou judge thy brother? or why dost thou set at nought thy brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt45014011-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v45014011-1">11 </span> For it is written, <span class="add">As</span> I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt45014012-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v45014012-1">12 </span> So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt45014013-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v45014013-1">13 </span> Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge this rather, that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in <span class="add">his</span> brother’s way.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt45014014-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v45014014-1">14 </span> I know, and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus, that <span class="add">there is</span> nothing unclean of itself: but to him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean, to him <span class="add">it is</span> unclean.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt45014015-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v45014015-1">15 </span> But if thy brother be grieved with <span class="add">thy</span> meat, now walkest thou not charitably.
