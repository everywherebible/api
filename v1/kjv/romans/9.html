God forbid.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt45009015-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v45009015-1">15 </span> For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt45009016-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v45009016-1">16 </span> So then <span class="add">it is</span> not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt45009017-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v45009017-1">17 </span> For the scripture saith unto Pharaoh, Even for this same purpose have I raised thee up, that I might shew my power in thee, and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt45009018-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v45009018-1">18 </span> Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will <span class="add">have mercy</span>, and whom he will he hardeneth.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt45009019-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v45009019-1">19 </span> Thou wilt say then unto me, Why doth he yet find fault?

Because <span class="add">they sought it</span> not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law. For they stumbled at that stumblingstone;  </span><span class="verse" id="vt45009033-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v45009033-1">33 </span> As it is written, Behold, I lay in Sion a stumblingstone and rock of offence: and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed. </span></p>
