For if through the offence of one many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, <span class="add">which is</span> by one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt45005016-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v45005016-1">16 </span> And not as <span class="add">it was</span> by one that sinned, <span class="add">so is</span> the gift: for the judgment <span class="add">was</span> by one to condemnation, but the free gift <span class="add">is</span> of many offences unto justification.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt45005017-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v45005017-1">17 </span> For if by one man’s offence death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.)  </span><span class="verse" id="vt45005018-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v45005018-1">18 </span> Therefore as by the offence of one <span class="add">judgment came</span> upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one <span class="add">the free gift came</span> upon all men unto justification of life.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt45005019-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v45005019-1">19 </span> For as by one man’s disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt45005020-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v45005020-1">20 </span> Moreover the law entered, that the offence might abound. But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound:  </span><span class="verse" id="vt45005021-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v45005021-1">21 </span> That as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might  grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord. </span></p>
