Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?  </span><span class="verse" id="vt45006002-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v45006002-1">2 </span> God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?  </span><span class="verse" id="vt45006003-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v45006003-1">3 </span> Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death?  </span><span class="verse" id="vt45006004-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v45006004-1">4 </span> Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt45006005-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v45006005-1">5 </span> For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also <span class="add">in the likeness</span> of <span class="add">his</span> resurrection:  </span><span class="verse" id="vt45006006-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v45006006-1">6 </span> Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with <span class="add">him</span>, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt45006007-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v45006007-1">7 </span> For he that is dead is freed from sin.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt45006008-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v45006008-1">8 </span> Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him:  </span><span class="verse" id="vt45006009-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v45006009-1">9 </span> Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over him.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt45006010-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v45006010-1">10 </span> For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt45006011-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v45006011-1">11 </span> Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt45006012-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v45006012-1">12 </span> Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt45006013-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v45006013-1">13 </span> Neither yield ye your members <span class="add">as</span> instruments of unrighteousness unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members <span class="add">as</span> instruments of righteousness unto God.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt45006014-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v45006014-1">14 </span> For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt45006015-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v45006015-1">15 </span> What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace?
