For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt45013002-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v45013002-1">2 </span> Whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God: and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt45013003-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v45013003-1">3 </span> For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise of the same:  </span><span class="verse" id="vt45013004-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v45013004-1">4 </span> For he is the minister of God to thee for good.
