<p> <span class="verse" id="vt58007001-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v58007001-1">1 </span> For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him;  </span><span class="verse" id="vt58007002-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v58007002-1">2 </span> To whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all; first being by interpretation King of righteousness, and after that also King of Salem, which is, King of peace;  </span><span class="verse" id="vt58007003-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v58007003-1">3 </span> Without father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life; but made like unto the Son of God; abideth a priest continually.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt58007004-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v58007004-1">4 </span> Now consider how great this man <span class="add">was</span>, unto whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt58007005-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v58007005-1">5 </span> And verily they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the office of the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brethren, though they come out of the loins of Abraham:  </span><span class="verse" id="vt58007006-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v58007006-1">6 </span> But he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of Abraham, and blessed him that had the promises.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt58007007-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v58007007-1">7 </span> And without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt58007008-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v58007008-1">8 </span> And here men that die receive tithes; but there he <span class="add">receiveth them</span>, of whom it is witnessed that he liveth.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt58007009-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v58007009-1">9 </span> And as I may so say, Levi also, who receiveth tithes, payed tithes in Abraham.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt58007010-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v58007010-1">10 </span> For he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedec met him.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt58007011-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v58007011-1">11 </span> If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for under it the people received the law,) what further need <span class="add">was there</span> that another priest should rise after the order of Melchisedec, and not be called after the order of Aaron?  </span><span class="verse" id="vt58007012-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v58007012-1">12 </span> For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt58007013-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v58007013-1">13 </span> For he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another tribe, of which no man gave attendance at the altar.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt58007014-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v58007014-1">14 </span> For <span class="add">it is</span> evident that our Lord sprang out of Juda; of which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt58007015-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v58007015-1">15 </span> And it is yet far more evident: for that after the similitude of Melchisedec there ariseth another priest,  </span><span class="verse" id="vt58007016-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v58007016-1">16 </span> Who is made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt58007017-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v58007017-1">17 </span> For he testifieth, Thou <span class="add">art</span> a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt58007018-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v58007018-1">18 </span> For there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt58007019-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v58007019-1">19 </span> For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope <span class="add">did</span>; by the which we draw nigh unto God.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt58007020-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v58007020-1">20 </span> And inasmuch as not without an oath <span class="add">he was made priest</span>:  </span><span class="verse" id="vt58007021-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v58007021-1">21 </span>(For those priests were made without an oath; but this with an oath by him that said unto him, The Lord sware and will not repent, Thou <span class="add">art</span> a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec:)  </span><span class="verse" id="vt58007022-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v58007022-1">22 </span> By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt58007023-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v58007023-1">23 </span> And they truly were many priests, because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death:  </span><span class="verse" id="vt58007024-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v58007024-1">24 </span> But this <span class="add">man</span>, because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt58007025-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v58007025-1">25 </span> Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt58007026-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v58007026-1">26 </span> For such an high priest became us, <span class="add">who is</span> holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;  </span><span class="verse" id="vt58007027-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v58007027-1">27 </span> Who needeth not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the people’s: for this he did once, when he offered up himself.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt58007028-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v58007028-1">28 </span> For the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was since the law, <span class="add">maketh</span> the Son, who is consecrated for evermore. </span></p>
