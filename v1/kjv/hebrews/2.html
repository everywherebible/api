<p> <span class="verse" id="vt58002001-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v58002001-1">1 </span> Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest at any time we should let <span class="add">them</span> slip.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt58002002-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v58002002-1">2 </span> For if the word spoken by angels was stedfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompence of reward;  </span><span class="verse" id="vt58002003-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v58002003-1">3 </span> How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard <span class="add">him</span>;  </span><span class="verse" id="vt58002004-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v58002004-1">4 </span> God also bearing <span class="add">them</span> witness, both with signs and wonders, and with divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost, according to his own will? </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt58002005-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v58002005-1">5 </span> For unto the angels hath he not put in subjection the world to come, whereof we speak.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt58002006-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v58002006-1">6 </span> But one in a certain place testified, saying, What is man, that thou art mindful of him? or the son of man, that thou visitest him?  </span><span class="verse" id="vt58002007-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v58002007-1">7 </span> Thou madest him a little lower than the angels; thou crownedst him with glory and honour, and didst set him over the works of thy hands:  </span><span class="verse" id="vt58002008-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v58002008-1">8 </span> Thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet. For in that he put all in subjection under him, he left nothing <span class="add">that is</span> not put under him. But now we see not yet all things put under him.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt58002009-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v58002009-1">9 </span> But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt58002010-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v58002010-1">10 </span> For it became him, for whom <span class="add">are</span> all things, and by whom <span class="add">are</span> all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt58002011-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v58002011-1">11 </span> For both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified <span class="add">are</span> all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren,  </span><span class="verse" id="vt58002012-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v58002012-1">12 </span> Saying, I will declare thy name unto my brethren, in the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt58002013-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v58002013-1">13 </span> And again, I will put my trust in him. And again, Behold I and the children which God hath given me.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt58002014-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v58002014-1">14 </span> Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil;  </span><span class="verse" id="vt58002015-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v58002015-1">15 </span> And deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt58002016-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v58002016-1">16 </span> For verily he took not on <span class="add">him the nature of</span> angels; but he took on <span class="add">him</span> the seed of Abraham.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt58002017-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v58002017-1">17 </span> Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto <span class="add">his</span> brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things <span class="add">pertaining</span> to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt58002018-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v58002018-1">18 </span> For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to succour them that are tempted. </span></p>
