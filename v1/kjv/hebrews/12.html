 </span><span class="verse" id="vt58012008-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v58012008-1">8 </span> But if ye be without chastisement, whereof all are partakers, then are ye bastards, and not sons.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt58012009-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v58012009-1">9 </span> Furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected <span class="add">us</span>, and we gave <span class="add">them</span> reverence: shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the Father of spirits, and live?  </span><span class="verse" id="vt58012010-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v58012010-1">10 </span> For they verily for a few days chastened <span class="add">us</span> after their own pleasure; but he for <span class="add">our</span> profit, that <span class="add">we</span> might be partakers of his holiness.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt58012011-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v58012011-1">11 </span> Now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous: nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt58012012-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v58012012-1">12 </span> Wherefore lift up the hands which hang down, and the feeble knees;  </span><span class="verse" id="vt58012013-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v58012013-1">13 </span> And make straight paths for your feet, lest that which is lame be turned out of the way; but let it rather be healed.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt58012014-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v58012014-1">14 </span> Follow peace with all <span class="add">men</span>, and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord:  </span><span class="verse" id="vt58012015-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v58012015-1">15 </span> Looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble  <span class="add">you</span>, and thereby many be defiled;  </span><span class="verse" id="vt58012016-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v58012016-1">16 </span> Lest there <span class="add">be</span> any fornicator, or profane person, as Esau, who for one morsel of meat sold his birthright.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt58012017-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v58012017-1">17 </span> For ye know how that afterward, when he would have inherited the blessing, he was rejected: for he found no place of repentance, though he sought it carefully with tears.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt58012018-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v58012018-1">18 </span> For ye are not come unto the mount that might be touched, and that burned with fire, nor unto blackness, and darkness, and tempest,  </span><span class="verse" id="vt58012019-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v58012019-1">19 </span> And the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words; which <span class="add">voice</span> they that heard intreated that the word should not be spoken to them any more:  </span><span class="verse" id="vt58012020-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v58012020-1">20 </span>(For they could not endure that which was commanded, And if so much as a beast touch the mountain, it shall be stoned, or thrust through with a dart:  </span><span class="verse" id="vt58012021-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v58012021-1">21 </span> And so terrible  was the sight, <span class="add">that</span> Moses said, I exceedingly fear and quake:)  </span><span class="verse" id="vt58012022-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v58012022-1">22 </span> But ye are come unto mount Sion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels,  </span><span class="verse" id="vt58012023-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v58012023-1">23 </span> To the general assembly and church of the firstborn, which are written in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect,  </span><span class="verse" id="vt58012024-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v58012024-1">24 </span> And to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, that speaketh better things than <span class="add">that of</span> Abel.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt58012025-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v58012025-1">25 </span> See that ye refuse not him that speaketh. For if they escaped not who refused him that spake on earth, much more <span class="add">shall not</span> we <span class="add">escape</span>, if we turn away from him that <span class="add">speaketh</span> from heaven:  </span><span class="verse" id="vt58012026-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v58012026-1">26 </span> Whose voice then shook the earth: but now he hath promised, saying, Yet once more I shake not the earth only, but also heaven.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt58012027-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v58012027-1">27 </span> And this <span class="add">word</span>, Yet once more, signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken, as of things that are made, that those things which cannot be shaken may remain.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt58012028-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v58012028-1">28 </span> Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear:  </span><span class="verse" id="vt58012029-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v58012029-1">29 </span> For our God <span class="add">is</span> a consuming fire. </span></p>
