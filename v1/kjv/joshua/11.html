<p> <span class="verse" id="vt06011001-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v06011001-1">1 </span> And it came to pass, when Jabin king of Hazor had heard <span class="add">those things</span>, that he sent to Jobab king of Madon, and to the king of Shimron, and to the king of Achshaph,  </span><span class="verse" id="vt06011002-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v06011002-1">2 </span> And to the kings that <span class="add">were</span> on the north of the mountains, and of the plains south of Chinneroth, and in the valley, and in the borders of Dor on the west,  </span><span class="verse" id="vt06011003-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v06011003-1">3 </span> <span class="add">And to</span> the Canaanite on the east and on the west, and <span class="add">to</span> the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Jebusite in the mountains, and <span class="add">to</span> the Hivite under Hermon in the land of Mizpeh.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt06011004-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v06011004-1">4 </span> And they went out, they and all their hosts with them, much people, even as the sand that <span class="add">is</span> upon the sea shore in multitude, with horses and chariots very many.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt06011005-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v06011005-1">5 </span> And when all these kings were met together, they came and pitched together at the waters of Merom, to fight against Israel.<a href="#FN1" class="footnote">*</a> </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt06011006-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v06011006-1">6 </span>¶ And the <span class="nd">LORD</span> said unto Joshua, Be not afraid because of them: for to morrow about this time will I deliver them up all slain before Israel: thou shalt hough their horses, and burn their chariots with fire.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt06011007-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v06011007-1">7 </span> So Joshua came, and all the people of war with him, against them by the waters of Merom suddenly; and they fell upon them.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt06011008-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v06011008-1">8 </span> And the <span class="nd">LORD</span> delivered  them into the hand of Israel, who smote them, and chased them unto great Zidon, and unto Misrephoth-maim, and unto the valley of Mizpeh eastward; and they smote them, until they left them none remaining.<a href="#FN2" class="footnote">†</a><a href="#FN3" class="footnote">‡</a>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt06011009-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v06011009-1">9 </span> And Joshua did unto them as the <span class="nd">LORD</span> bade him: he houghed their horses, and burnt their chariots with fire. </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt06011010-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v06011010-1">10 </span>¶ And Joshua at that time turned back, and took Hazor, and smote the king thereof with the sword: for Hazor beforetime was the head of all those kingdoms.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt06011011-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v06011011-1">11 </span> And they smote all the souls that <span class="add">were</span> therein with the edge of the sword, utterly destroying <span class="add">them:</span> there was not any left to breathe: and he burnt Hazor with fire.<a href="#FN4" class="footnote">§</a>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt06011012-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v06011012-1">12 </span> And all the cities of those kings, and all the kings of them, did Joshua take, and smote them with the edge of the sword, <span class="add">and</span> he utterly destroyed them, as Moses the servant of the <span class="nd">LORD</span> commanded.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt06011013-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v06011013-1">13 </span>But <span class="add">as for</span> the cities that stood still in their strength, Israel burned none of them, save Hazor only;
