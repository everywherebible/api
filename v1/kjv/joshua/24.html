and they presented themselves before God.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt06024002-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v06024002-1">2 </span> And Joshua said unto all the people, Thus saith the <span class="nd">LORD</span> God of Israel, Your fathers dwelt on the other side of the flood in old time, <span class="add">even</span> Terah, the father of Abraham, and the father of Nachor: and they served other gods.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt06024003-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v06024003-1">3 </span> And I took your father Abraham from the other side of the flood, and led him throughout all the land of Canaan, and multiplied his seed, and gave him Isaac.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt06024004-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v06024004-1">4 </span> And I gave unto Isaac Jacob and Esau: and I gave unto Esau mount Seir, to possess it; but Jacob and his children went down into Egypt.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt06024005-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v06024005-1">5 </span> I sent Moses also and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt, according to that which I did among them: and afterward I brought you out.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt06024006-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v06024006-1">6 </span> And I brought your fathers out of Egypt: and ye came unto the sea; and the Egyptians pursued after your fathers with chariots and horsemen unto the Red sea.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt06024007-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v06024007-1">7 </span> And when they cried unto the <span class="nd">LORD</span>, he put darkness between you and the Egyptians, and brought the sea upon them, and covered them; and your eyes have seen what I have done in Egypt: and ye dwelt in the wilderness a long season.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt06024008-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v06024008-1">8 </span> And I brought you into the land of the Amorites, which dwelt on the other side Jordan; and they fought with you: and I gave them into your hand, that ye might possess their land; and I destroyed them from before you.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt06024009-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v06024009-1">9 </span> Then Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose and warred against Israel, and sent and called Balaam the son of Beor to curse you:  </span><span class="verse" id="vt06024010-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v06024010-1">10 </span> But I would not hearken unto Balaam; therefore he blessed you still: so I delivered you out of his hand.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt06024011-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v06024011-1">11 </span> And ye went over Jordan, and came unto Jericho: and the men of Jericho fought against you, the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Girgashites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites; and I delivered them into your hand.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt06024012-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v06024012-1">12 </span> And I sent the hornet before you, which drave them out from before you, <span class="add">even</span> the two kings of the Amorites; <span class="add">but</span> not with thy sword, nor with thy bow.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt06024013-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v06024013-1">13 </span> And I have given you a land for which ye did not labour, and cities which ye built not, and ye dwell in them; of the vineyards and oliveyards which ye planted not do ye eat. </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt06024014-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v06024014-1">14 </span>¶ Now therefore fear the <span class="nd">LORD</span>, and serve him in sincerity and in truth: and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the flood, and in Egypt; and serve ye the <span class="nd">LORD</span>. </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt06024015-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v06024015-1">15 </span> And if it seem evil unto you to serve the <span class="nd">LORD</span>, choose you this day whom ye will serve; whether the gods which your fathers served that <span class="add">were</span> on the other side of the flood, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but as for me and my house, we will serve the <span class="nd">LORD</span>.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt06024016-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v06024016-1">16 </span> And the people answered and said, God forbid that we should forsake the <span class="nd">LORD</span>, to serve other gods;  </span><span class="verse" id="vt06024017-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v06024017-1">17 </span> For the <span class="nd">LORD</span> our God, he <span class="add">it is</span> that brought us up and our fathers out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage, and which did those great signs in our sight, and preserved us in all the way wherein we went, and among all the people through whom we passed:  </span><span class="verse" id="vt06024018-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v06024018-1">18 </span> And the <span class="nd">LORD</span> drave out from before us all the people, even the Amorites which dwelt in the land: <span class="add">therefore</span> will we also serve the <span class="nd">LORD</span>; for he <span class="add">is</span> our God.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt06024019-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v06024019-1">19 </span> And Joshua said unto the people, Ye cannot serve the <span class="nd">LORD</span>: for he <span class="add">is</span> an holy God;
