but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt50002004-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v50002004-1">4 </span> Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt50002005-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v50002005-1">5 </span> Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:  </span><span class="verse" id="vt50002006-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v50002006-1">6 </span> Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God:  </span><span class="verse" id="vt50002007-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v50002007-1">7 </span> But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men:  </span><span class="verse" id="vt50002008-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v50002008-1">8 </span> And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt50002009-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v50002009-1">9 </span> Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name:  </span><span class="verse" id="vt50002010-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v50002010-1">10 </span> That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of <span class="add">things</span> in heaven, and <span class="add">things</span> in earth, and <span class="add">things</span> under the earth;  </span><span class="verse" id="vt50002011-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v50002011-1">11 </span> And <span class="add">that</span> every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ <span class="add">is</span> Lord, to the glory of God the Father. </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt50002012-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v50002012-1">12 </span> Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt50002013-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v50002013-1">13 </span> For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of <span class="add">his</span> good pleasure.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt50002014-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v50002014-1">14 </span> Do all things without murmurings and disputings:  </span><span class="verse" id="vt50002015-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v50002015-1">15 </span> That ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world;  </span><span class="verse" id="vt50002016-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v50002016-1">16 </span> Holding forth the word of life; that I may rejoice in the day of Christ, that I have not run in vain, neither laboured in vain.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt50002017-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v50002017-1">17 </span> Yea, and if I be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt50002018-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v50002018-1">18 </span> For the same cause also do ye joy, and rejoice with me. </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt50002019-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v50002019-1">19 </span> But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timotheus shortly unto you, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know your state.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt50002020-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v50002020-1">20 </span> For I have no man likeminded, who will naturally care for your state.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt50002021-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v50002021-1">21 </span> For all seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ’s.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt50002022-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v50002022-1">22 </span> But ye know the proof of him, that, as a son with the father, he hath served with me in the gospel.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt50002023-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v50002023-1">23 </span> Him therefore I hope to send presently, so soon as I shall see how it will go with me.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt50002024-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v50002024-1">24 </span> But I trust in the Lord that I also myself shall come shortly.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt50002025-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v50002025-1">25 </span> Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, and companion in labour, and fellowsoldier, but your messenger, and he that ministered to my wants.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt50002026-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v50002026-1">26 </span> For he longed after you all, and was full of heaviness, because that ye had heard that he had been sick.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt50002027-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v50002027-1">27 </span> For indeed he was sick nigh unto death: but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt50002028-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v50002028-1">28 </span> I sent him therefore the more carefully, that, when ye see him again, ye may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt50002029-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v50002029-1">29 </span> Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness; and hold such in reputation:  </span><span class="verse" id="vt50002030-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v50002030-1">30 </span> Because for the work of Christ he was nigh unto death, not regarding his life, to supply your lack of service toward me. </span></p>
