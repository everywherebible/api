your lips have spoken lies, your tongue hath muttered perverseness.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt23059004-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v23059004-1">4 </span> None calleth for justice, nor <span class="add">any</span> pleadeth for truth: they trust in vanity, and speak lies; they conceive mischief, and bring forth iniquity.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt23059005-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v23059005-1">5 </span> They hatch cockatrice’ eggs, and weave the spider’s web: he that eateth of their eggs dieth, and that which is crushed breaketh out into a viper.<a href="#FN2" class="footnote">†</a><a href="#FN3" class="footnote">‡</a>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt23059006-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v23059006-1">6 </span> Their webs shall not become garments, neither shall they cover themselves with their works: their works <span class="add">are</span> works of iniquity, and the act of violence <span class="add">is</span> in their hands.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt23059007-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v23059007-1">7 </span> Their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed innocent blood: their thoughts <span class="add">are</span> thoughts of iniquity; wasting and destruction <span class="add">are</span> in their paths.<a href="#FN4" class="footnote">§</a>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt23059008-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v23059008-1">8 </span> The way of peace they know not;

<span class="add">we are</span> in desolate places as dead <span class="add">men</span>.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt23059011-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v23059011-1">11 </span> We roar all like bears, and mourn sore like doves: we look for judgment, but <span class="add">there is</span> none;
