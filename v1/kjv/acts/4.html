<p> <span class="verse" id="vt44004001-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44004001-1">1 </span> And as they spake unto the people, the priests, and the captain of the temple, and the Sadducees, came upon them,  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44004002-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44004002-1">2 </span> Being grieved that they taught the people, and preached through Jesus the resurrection from the dead.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44004003-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44004003-1">3 </span> And they laid hands on them, and put <span class="add">them</span> in hold unto the next day: for it was now eventide.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44004004-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44004004-1">4 </span> Howbeit many of them which heard the word believed; and the number of the men was about five thousand. </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt44004005-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44004005-1">5 </span>¶ And it came to pass on the morrow, that their rulers, and elders, and scribes,  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44004006-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44004006-1">6 </span> And Annas the high priest, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest, were gathered together at Jerusalem.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44004007-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44004007-1">7 </span> And when they had set them in the midst, they asked, By what power, or by what name, have ye done this?  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44004008-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44004008-1">8 </span> Then Peter, filled with the Holy Ghost, said unto them, Ye rulers of the people, and elders of Israel,  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44004009-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44004009-1">9 </span> If we this day be examined of the good deed done to the impotent man, by what means he is made whole;  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44004010-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44004010-1">10 </span> Be it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead, <span class="add">even</span> by him doth this man stand here before you whole.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44004011-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44004011-1">11 </span> This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders, which is become the head of the corner.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44004012-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44004012-1">12 </span> Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved. </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt44004013-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44004013-1">13 </span>¶ Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marvelled; and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44004014-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44004014-1">14 </span> And beholding the man which was healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44004015-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44004015-1">15 </span> But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council, they conferred among themselves,  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44004016-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44004016-1">16 </span> Saying, What shall we do to these men? for that indeed a notable miracle hath been done by them <span class="add">is</span> manifest to all them that dwell in Jerusalem; and we cannot  deny <span class="add">it</span>.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44004017-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44004017-1">17 </span> But that it spread no further among the people, let us straitly threaten them, that they speak henceforth to no man in this name.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44004018-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44004018-1">18 </span> And they called them, and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44004019-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44004019-1">19 </span> But Peter and John answered and said unto them, Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44004020-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44004020-1">20 </span> For we cannot  but speak the things which we have seen and heard.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44004021-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44004021-1">21 </span> So when they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding nothing how they might punish them, because of the people: for all <span class="add">men</span> glorified God for that which was done.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44004022-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44004022-1">22 </span> For the man was above forty years old, on whom this miracle of healing was shewed. </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt44004023-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44004023-1">23 </span>¶ And being let go, they went to their own company, and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said unto them.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44004024-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44004024-1">24 </span> And when they heard that, they lifted up their voice to God with one accord, and said, Lord, thou <span class="add">art</span> God, which hast made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all that in them is:  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44004025-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44004025-1">25 </span> Who by the mouth of thy servant David hast said, Why did the heathen rage, and the people imagine vain things?  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44004026-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44004026-1">26 </span> The kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord, and against his Christ.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44004027-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44004027-1">27 </span> For of a truth against thy holy child Jesus, whom thou hast anointed, both Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles, and the people of Israel, were gathered together,  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44004028-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44004028-1">28 </span> For to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel determined before to be done.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44004029-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44004029-1">29 </span> And now, Lord, behold their threatenings: and grant unto thy servants, that with all boldness they may speak thy word,  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44004030-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44004030-1">30 </span> By stretching forth thine hand to heal; and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of thy holy child Jesus. </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt44004031-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44004031-1">31 </span>¶ And when they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were assembled together; and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and they spake the word of God with boldness.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44004032-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44004032-1">32 </span> And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul: neither said any <span class="add">of them</span> that ought of the things which he possessed was his own; but they had all things common.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44004033-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44004033-1">33 </span> And with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus: and great grace was upon them all.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44004034-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44004034-1">34 </span> Neither was there any among them that lacked: for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the prices of the things that were sold,  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44004035-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44004035-1">35 </span> And laid <span class="add">them</span> down at the apostles’ feet: and distribution was made unto every man according as he had need.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44004036-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44004036-1">36 </span> And Joses, who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas, (which is, being interpreted, The son of consolation,) a Levite, <span class="add">and</span> of the country of Cyprus,  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44004037-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44004037-1">37 </span> Having land, sold <span class="add">it</span>, and brought the money, and laid <span class="add">it</span> at the apostles’ feet. </span></p>
