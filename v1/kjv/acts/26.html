Then Paul stretched forth the hand, and answered for himself:  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44026002-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44026002-1">2 </span> I think myself happy, king Agrippa, because I shall answer for myself this day before thee touching all the things whereof I am accused of the Jews:  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44026003-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44026003-1">3 </span> Especially <span class="add">because I know</span> thee to be expert in all customs and questions which are among the Jews: wherefore I beseech thee to hear me patiently.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44026004-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44026004-1">4 </span> My manner of life from my youth, which was at the first among mine own nation at Jerusalem, know all the Jews;  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44026005-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44026005-1">5 </span> Which knew me from the beginning, if they would testify, that after the most straitest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44026006-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44026006-1">6 </span> And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made of God unto our fathers:  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44026007-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44026007-1">7 </span> Unto which <span class="add">promise</span> our twelve tribes, instantly serving <span class="add">God</span> day and night, hope to come. For which hope’s sake, king Agrippa, I am accused of the Jews.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44026008-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44026008-1">8 </span> Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you, that God should raise the dead?  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44026009-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44026009-1">9 </span> I verily thought with myself, that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44026010-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44026010-1">10 </span> Which thing I also did in Jerusalem: and many of the saints did I shut up in prison, having received authority from the chief priests; and when they were put to death, I gave my voice against <span class="add">them</span>.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44026011-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44026011-1">11 </span> And I punished them oft in every synagogue, and compelled <span class="add">them</span> to blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted <span class="add">them</span> even unto strange cities.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44026012-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44026012-1">12 </span> Whereupon as I went to Damascus with authority and commission from the chief priests,  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44026013-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44026013-1">13 </span> At midday, O king, I saw in the way a light from heaven, above the brightness of the sun, shining round about me and them which journeyed with me.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44026014-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44026014-1">14 </span> And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speaking unto me, and saying in the Hebrew tongue, <span class="wj"> Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? <span class="add">it is</span> hard for thee to kick against the pricks.</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44026015-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44026015-1">15 </span> And I said, Who art thou, Lord? And he said, <span class="wj"> I am Jesus whom thou persecutest.</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44026016-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44026016-1">16 </span> <span class="wj"> But rise, and stand upon thy feet: for I have appeared unto thee for this purpose, to make thee a minister and a witness both of these things which thou hast seen, and of those things in the which I will appear unto thee;</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44026017-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44026017-1">17 </span> <span class="wj"> Delivering thee from the people, and <span class="add">from</span> the Gentiles, unto whom now I send thee,</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44026018-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44026018-1">18 </span> <span class="wj"> To open their eyes, <span class="add"> and</span> to turn <span class="add">them</span> from darkness to light, and <span class="add">from</span> the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me.</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44026019-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44026019-1">19 </span> Whereupon, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision:  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44026020-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44026020-1">20 </span> But shewed first unto them of Damascus, and at Jerusalem, and throughout all the coasts of Judæa, and <span class="add">then</span> to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, and do works meet for repentance.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44026021-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44026021-1">21 </span> For these causes the Jews caught me in the temple, and went about to kill <span class="add">me</span>.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44026022-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44026022-1">22 </span> Having therefore obtained help of God, I continue unto this day, witnessing both to small and great, saying none other things than those which the prophets and Moses did say should come:  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44026023-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44026023-1">23 </span> That Christ should suffer, <span class="add">and</span> that he should be the first that should rise from the dead, and should shew light unto the people, and to the Gentiles. </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt44026024-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44026024-1">24 </span> And as he thus spake for himself, Festus said with a loud voice, Paul, thou art beside thyself; much learning doth make thee mad.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44026025-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44026025-1">25 </span> But he said, I am not mad, most noble Festus; but speak forth the words of truth and soberness.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44026026-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44026026-1">26 </span> For the king knoweth of these things, before whom also I speak freely: for I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him; for this thing was not done in a corner.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44026027-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44026027-1">27 </span> King Agrippa, believest thou the prophets? I know that thou believest.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44026028-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44026028-1">28 </span> Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44026029-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44026029-1">29 </span> And Paul said, I would to God, that not only thou, but also all that hear me this day, were both almost, and altogether such as I am, except these bonds.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44026030-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44026030-1">30 </span> And when he had thus spoken, the king rose up, and the governor, and Bernice, and they that sat with them:  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44026031-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44026031-1">31 </span> And when they were gone aside, they talked between themselves, saying, This man doeth nothing worthy of death or of bonds.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44026032-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44026032-1">32 </span> Then said Agrippa unto Festus, This man might have been set at liberty, if he had not appealed unto Cæsar. </span></p>
