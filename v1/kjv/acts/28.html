who received us, and lodged us three days courteously.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44028008-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44028008-1">8 </span> And it came to pass, that the father of Publius lay sick of a fever and of a bloody flux: to whom Paul entered in, and prayed, and laid his hands on him, and healed him.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44028009-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44028009-1">9 </span> So when this was done, others also, which had diseases in the island, came, and were healed:  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44028010-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44028010-1">10 </span> Who also honoured us with many honours; and when we departed, they laded <span class="add">us</span> with such things as were necessary. </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt44028011-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44028011-1">11 </span> And after three months we departed in a ship of Alexandria, which had wintered in the isle, whose sign was Castor and Pollux.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44028012-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44028012-1">12 </span> And landing at Syracuse, we tarried <span class="add">there</span> three days.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44028013-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44028013-1">13 </span> And from thence we fetched a compass, and came to Rhegium: and after one day the south wind blew, and we came the next day to Puteoli:  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44028014-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44028014-1">14 </span> Where we found brethren, and were desired to tarry with them seven days: and so we went toward Rome.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44028015-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44028015-1">15 </span> And from thence, when the brethren heard of us, they came to meet us as far as Appii forum, and The three taverns: whom when Paul saw, he thanked God, and took courage.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44028016-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44028016-1">16 </span> And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard: but Paul was suffered to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him. </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt44028017-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44028017-1">17 </span> And it came to pass, that after three days Paul called the chief of the Jews together: and when they were come together, he said unto them, Men <span class="add">and</span> brethren, though I have committed nothing against the people, or customs of our fathers, yet was I delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44028018-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44028018-1">18 </span> Who, when they had examined me, would have let <span class="add">me</span> go, because there was no cause of death in me.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44028019-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44028019-1">19 </span> But when the Jews spake against <span class="add">it</span>, I was constrained to appeal unto Cæsar; not that I had ought to accuse my nation of.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44028020-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44028020-1">20 </span> For this cause therefore have I called for you, to see <span class="add">you</span>, and to speak with <span class="add">you</span>: because that for the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44028021-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44028021-1">21 </span> And they said unto him, We neither received letters out of Judæa concerning thee, neither any of the brethren that came shewed or spake any harm of thee.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44028022-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44028022-1">22 </span> But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest: for as concerning  this sect, we know that every where it is spoken against.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44028023-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44028023-1">23 </span> And when they had appointed him a day, there came many to him into <span class="add">his</span> lodging; to whom he expounded and testified the kingdom of God, persuading them concerning Jesus, both out of the law of Moses, and <span class="add">out of</span> the prophets, from morning till evening.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44028024-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44028024-1">24 </span> And some believed the things which were spoken, and some believed not.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44028025-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44028025-1">25 </span> And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed, after that Paul had spoken one word, Well spake the Holy Ghost by Esaias the prophet unto our fathers,  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44028026-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44028026-1">26 </span> Saying, Go unto this people, and say, Hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and not perceive:  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44028027-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44028027-1">27 </span> For the heart of this people is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes have they closed; lest they should see with <span class="add">their</span> eyes, and hear with <span class="add">their</span> ears, and understand with <span class="add">their</span> heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44028028-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44028028-1">28 </span> Be it known therefore unto you, that the salvation of God is sent unto the Gentiles, and <span class="add">that</span> they will hear it.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44028029-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44028029-1">29 </span> And when he had said these words, the Jews departed, and had great reasoning among themselves. </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt44028030-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44028030-1">30 </span> And Paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired house, and received all that came in unto him,  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44028031-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44028031-1">31 </span> Preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching those things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ, with all confidence, no man forbidding him. </span></p>
