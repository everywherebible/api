<p> <span class="verse" id="vt44024001-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44024001-1">1 </span> And after five days Ananias the high priest descended with the elders, and <span class="add">with</span> a certain orator <span class="add">named</span> Tertullus, who informed the governor against Paul.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44024002-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44024002-1">2 </span> And when he was called forth, Tertullus began to accuse <span class="add">him</span>, saying, Seeing that by thee we enjoy great quietness, and that very worthy deeds are done unto this nation by thy providence,  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44024003-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44024003-1">3 </span> We accept <span class="add">it</span> always, and in all places, most noble Felix, with all thankfulness.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44024004-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44024004-1">4 </span> Notwithstanding, that I be not further tedious unto thee, I pray thee that thou wouldest hear us of thy clemency a few words.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44024005-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44024005-1">5 </span> For we have found this man <span class="add">a</span> pestilent <span class="add">fellow</span>, and a mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes:  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44024006-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44024006-1">6 </span> Who also hath gone about to profane the temple: whom we took, and would have judged according to our law.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44024007-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44024007-1">7 </span> But the chief captain Lysias came <span class="add">upon us</span>, and with great violence took <span class="add">him</span> away out of our hands,  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44024008-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44024008-1">8 </span> Commanding his accusers to come unto thee: by examining of whom thyself mayest take knowledge of all these things, whereof we accuse him.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44024009-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44024009-1">9 </span> And the Jews also assented, saying that these things were so.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44024010-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44024010-1">10 </span> Then Paul, after that the governor had beckoned unto him to speak, answered, Forasmuch as I know that thou hast been of many years a judge unto this nation, I do the more cheerfully answer for myself:  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44024011-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44024011-1">11 </span> Because that thou mayest understand, that there are yet but twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem for to worship.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44024012-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44024012-1">12 </span> And they neither found me in the temple disputing with any man, neither raising up the people, neither in the synagogues, nor in the city:  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44024013-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44024013-1">13 </span> Neither can they prove the things whereof they now accuse me.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44024014-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44024014-1">14 </span> But this I confess unto thee, that after the way which they call heresy, so worship I the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets:  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44024015-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44024015-1">15 </span> And have hope toward God, which they themselves also allow, that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44024016-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44024016-1">16 </span> And herein do I exercise myself, to have always a conscience void of offence toward God, and <span class="add">toward</span> men.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44024017-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44024017-1">17 </span> Now after many years I came to bring alms to my nation, and offerings.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44024018-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44024018-1">18 </span> Whereupon certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple, neither with multitude, nor with tumult.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44024019-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44024019-1">19 </span> Who ought to have been here before thee, and object, if they had ought against me.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44024020-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44024020-1">20 </span> Or else let these same <span class="add">here</span> say, if they have found any evil doing in me, while I stood before the council,  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44024021-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44024021-1">21 </span> Except it be for this one voice, that I cried standing among them, Touching the resurrection of the dead I am called in question by you this day. </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt44024022-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44024022-1">22 </span> And when Felix heard these things, having more perfect knowledge of <span class="add">that</span> way, he deferred them, and said, When Lysias the chief captain shall come down, I will know the uttermost of your matter.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44024023-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44024023-1">23 </span> And he commanded a centurion to keep Paul, and to let <span class="add">him</span> have liberty, and that he should forbid none of his acquaintance to minister or come unto him. </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt44024024-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44024024-1">24 </span> And after certain days, when Felix came with his wife Drusilla, which was a Jewess, he sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44024025-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44024025-1">25 </span> And as he reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come, Felix trembled, and answered, Go thy way for this time; when I have a convenient season, I will call for thee.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44024026-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44024026-1">26 </span> He hoped also that money should have been given him of Paul, that he might loose him: wherefore he sent for him the oftener, and communed with him.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44024027-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44024027-1">27 </span> But after two years Porcius Festus came into Felix’ room: and Felix, willing to shew the Jews a pleasure, left Paul bound. </span></p>
