<p> <span class="verse" id="vt44022001-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44022001-1">1 </span> Men, brethren, and fathers, hear ye my defence <span class="add">which I make</span> now unto you.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44022002-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44022002-1">2 </span>(And when they heard that he spake in the Hebrew tongue to them, they kept the more silence: and he saith,)  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44022003-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44022003-1">3 </span> I am verily a man <span class="add">which am</span> a Jew, born in Tarsus, <span class="add">a city</span> in Cilicia, yet brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, <span class="add">and</span> taught according to the perfect manner of the law of the fathers, and was zealous toward God, as ye all are this day.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44022004-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44022004-1">4 </span> And I persecuted this way unto the death, binding and delivering into prisons both men and women.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44022005-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44022005-1">5 </span> As also the high priest doth bear me witness, and all the estate of the elders: from whom also I received letters unto the brethren, and went to Damascus, to bring them which were there bound unto Jerusalem, for to be punished.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44022006-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44022006-1">6 </span> And it came to pass, that, as I made my journey, and was come nigh unto Damascus about noon, suddenly there shone from heaven a great light round about me.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44022007-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44022007-1">7 </span> And I fell unto the ground, and heard a voice saying unto me, <span class="woc"> Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44022008-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44022008-1">8 </span> And I answered, Who art thou, Lord? And he said unto me, <span class="woc"> I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom thou persecutest.</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44022009-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44022009-1">9 </span> And they that were with me saw indeed the light, and were afraid; but they heard not the voice of him that spake to me.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44022010-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44022010-1">10 </span> And I said, What shall I do, Lord? And the Lord said unto me, <span class="woc"> Arise, and go into Damascus; and there it shall be told thee of all things which are appointed for thee to do.</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44022011-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44022011-1">11 </span> And when I could not see for the glory of that light, being led by the hand of them that were with me, I came into Damascus.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44022012-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44022012-1">12 </span> And one Ananias, a devout man according to the law, having a good report of all the Jews which dwelt <span class="add">there</span>,  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44022013-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44022013-1">13 </span> Came unto me, and stood, and said unto me, Brother Saul, receive thy sight. And the same hour I looked up upon him.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44022014-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44022014-1">14 </span> And he said, The God of our fathers hath chosen thee, that thou shouldest know his will, and see that Just One, and shouldest hear the voice of his mouth.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44022015-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44022015-1">15 </span> For thou shalt be his witness unto all men of what thou hast seen and heard.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44022016-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44022016-1">16 </span> And now why tarriest thou? arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44022017-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44022017-1">17 </span> And it came to pass, that, when I was come again to Jerusalem, even while I prayed in the temple, I was in a trance;  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44022018-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44022018-1">18 </span> And saw him saying unto me, <span class="woc"> Make haste, and get thee quickly out of Jerusalem: for they will not receive thy testimony concerning me.</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44022019-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44022019-1">19 </span> And I said, Lord, they know that I imprisoned and beat in every synagogue them that believed on thee:  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44022020-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44022020-1">20 </span> And when the blood of thy martyr Stephen was shed, I also was standing by, and consenting unto his death, and kept the raiment of them that slew him.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44022021-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44022021-1">21 </span> And he said unto me, <span class="woc"> Depart: for I will send thee far hence unto the Gentiles.</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44022022-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44022022-1">22 </span> And they gave him audience unto this word, and <span class="add">then</span> lifted up their voices, and said, Away with such a <span class="add">fellow</span> from the earth: for it is not fit that he should live.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44022023-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44022023-1">23 </span> And as they cried out, and cast off <span class="add">their</span> clothes, and threw dust into the air,  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44022024-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44022024-1">24 </span> The chief captain commanded him to be brought into the castle, and bade that he should be examined by scourging; that he might know wherefore they cried so against him.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44022025-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44022025-1">25 </span> And as they bound him with thongs, Paul said unto the centurion that stood by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a Roman, and uncondemned?  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44022026-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44022026-1">26 </span> When the centurion heard <span class="add">that</span>, he went and told the chief captain, saying, Take heed what thou doest: for this man is a Roman.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44022027-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44022027-1">27 </span> Then the chief captain came, and said unto him, Tell me, art thou a Roman? He said, Yea.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44022028-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44022028-1">28 </span> And the chief captain answered, With a great sum obtained I this freedom. And Paul said, But I was <span class="add">free</span> born.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44022029-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44022029-1">29 </span> Then straightway they departed from him which should have examined him: and the chief captain also was afraid, after he knew that he was a Roman, and because he had bound him.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44022030-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44022030-1">30 </span> On the morrow, because he would have known the certainty wherefore he was accused of the Jews, he loosed him from <span class="add">his</span> bands, and commanded the chief priests and all their council to appear, and brought Paul down, and set him before them. </span></p>
