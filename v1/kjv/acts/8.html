And at that time there was a great persecution against the church which was at Jerusalem; and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judæa and Samaria, except the apostles.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44008002-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44008002-1">2 </span> And devout men carried Stephen <span class="add">to his burial</span>, and made great lamentation over him.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44008003-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44008003-1">3 </span> As for Saul, he made havock of the church, entering into every house, and haling men and women committed <span class="add">them</span> to prison.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44008004-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44008004-1">4 </span> Therefore they that were scattered abroad went every where preaching the word.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44008005-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44008005-1">5 </span> Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and preached Christ unto them.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44008006-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44008006-1">6 </span> And the people with one accord gave heed unto those things which Philip spake, hearing and seeing the miracles which he did.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44008007-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44008007-1">7 </span> For unclean spirits, crying with loud voice, came out of many that were possessed <span class="add">with them</span>: and many taken with palsies, and that were lame, were healed.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44008008-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44008008-1">8 </span> And there was great joy in that city.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44008009-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44008009-1">9 </span> But there was a certain man, called Simon, which beforetime in the same city used sorcery, and bewitched the people of Samaria, giving out that himself was some great one:  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44008010-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44008010-1">10 </span> To whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is the great power of God.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44008011-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44008011-1">11 </span> And to him they had regard, because that of long time he had bewitched them with sorceries.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44008012-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44008012-1">12 </span> But when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44008013-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44008013-1">13 </span> Then Simon himself believed also: and when he was baptized, he continued with Philip, and wondered, beholding the miracles and signs which were done.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44008014-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44008014-1">14 </span> Now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John:  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44008015-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44008015-1">15 </span> Who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Ghost:  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44008016-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44008016-1">16 </span>(For as yet he was fallen upon none of them: only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.)  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44008017-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44008017-1">17 </span> Then laid they <span class="add">their</span> hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghost.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44008018-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44008018-1">18 </span> And when Simon saw that through laying on of the apostles’ hands the Holy Ghost was given, he offered them money,  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44008019-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44008019-1">19 </span> Saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay hands, he may receive the Holy Ghost.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44008020-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44008020-1">20 </span> But Peter said unto him, Thy money perish with thee, because thou hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44008021-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44008021-1">21 </span> Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter: for thy heart is not right in the sight of God.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44008022-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44008022-1">22 </span> Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44008023-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44008023-1">23 </span> For I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness, and <span class="add">in</span> the bond of iniquity.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44008024-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44008024-1">24 </span> Then answered Simon, and said, Pray ye to the Lord for me, that none of these things which ye have spoken come upon me.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44008025-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44008025-1">25 </span> And they, when they had testified and preached the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel in many villages of the Samaritans.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44008026-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44008026-1">26 </span> And the angel of the Lord spake unto Philip, saying, Arise, and go toward the south unto the way that goeth down from Jerusalem unto Gaza, which is desert.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44008027-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44008027-1">27 </span> And he arose and went: and, behold, a man of Ethiopia, an eunuch of great authority under Candace queen of the Ethiopians, who had the charge of all her treasure, and had come to Jerusalem for to worship,  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44008028-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44008028-1">28 </span> Was returning, and sitting in his chariot read Esaias the prophet.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44008029-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44008029-1">29 </span> Then the Spirit said unto Philip, Go near, and join thyself to this chariot.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44008030-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44008030-1">30 </span> And Philip ran thither to <span class="add">him</span>, and heard him read the prophet Esaias, and said, Understandest thou what thou readest?  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44008031-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44008031-1">31 </span> And he said, How can I, except some man should guide me? And he desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44008032-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44008032-1">32 </span> The place of the scripture which he read was this, He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and like a lamb dumb before his shearer, so opened he not his mouth:  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44008033-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44008033-1">33 </span> In his humiliation his judgment was taken away: and who shall declare his generation? for his life is taken from the earth.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44008034-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44008034-1">34 </span> And the eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray thee, of whom speaketh the prophet this? of himself, or of some other man?  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44008035-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44008035-1">35 </span> Then Philip opened his mouth, and began at the same scripture, and preached unto him Jesus.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44008036-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44008036-1">36 </span> And as they went on <span class="add">their</span> way, they came unto a certain water: and the eunuch said, See, <span class="add">here is</span> water; what doth hinder me to be baptized?  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44008037-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44008037-1">37 </span> And Philip said, If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest. And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44008038-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44008038-1">38 </span> And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they went down both into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44008039-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44008039-1">39 </span> And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip, that the eunuch saw him no more: and he went on his way rejoicing.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44008040-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44008040-1">40 </span> But Philip was found at Azotus: and passing through he preached in all the cities, till he came to Cæsarea. </span></p>
