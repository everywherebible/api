And he said unto him, Thy prayers and thine alms are come up for a memorial before God.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44010005-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44010005-1">5 </span> And now send men to Joppa, and call for <span class="add">one</span> Simon, whose surname is Peter:  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44010006-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44010006-1">6 </span> He lodgeth with one Simon a tanner, whose house is by the sea side: he shall tell thee what thou oughtest to do.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44010007-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44010007-1">7 </span> And when the angel which spake unto Cornelius was departed, he called two of his household servants, and a devout soldier of them that waited on him continually;  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44010008-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44010008-1">8 </span> And when he had declared all <span class="add">these</span> things unto them, he sent them to Joppa. </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt44010009-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44010009-1">9 </span>¶ On the morrow, as they went on their journey, and drew nigh unto the city, Peter went up upon the housetop to pray about the sixth hour:  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44010010-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44010010-1">10 </span> And he became very hungry, and would have eaten: but while they made ready, he fell into a trance,  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44010011-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44010011-1">11 </span> And saw heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending unto him, as it had been a great sheet knit at the four corners, and let down to the earth:  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44010012-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44010012-1">12 </span> Wherein were all manner of fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44010013-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44010013-1">13 </span> And there came a voice to him, Rise, Peter; kill, and eat.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44010014-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44010014-1">14 </span> But Peter said, Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten any thing that is common or unclean.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44010015-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44010015-1">15 </span> And the voice <span class="add">spake</span> unto him again the second time, What God hath cleansed, <span class="add">that</span> call not thou common.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44010016-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44010016-1">16 </span> This was done thrice: and the vessel was received up again into heaven.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44010017-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44010017-1">17 </span> Now while Peter doubted in himself what this vision which he had seen should mean, behold, the men which were sent from Cornelius had made enquiry for Simon’s house, and stood before the gate,  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44010018-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44010018-1">18 </span> And called, and asked whether Simon, which was surnamed Peter, were lodged there. </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt44010019-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44010019-1">19 </span>¶ While Peter thought on the vision, the Spirit said unto him, Behold, three men seek thee.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44010020-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44010020-1">20 </span> Arise therefore, and get thee down, and go with them, doubting nothing: for I have sent them.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44010021-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44010021-1">21 </span> Then Peter went down to the men which were sent unto him from Cornelius; and said, Behold, I am he whom ye seek: what <span class="add">is</span> the cause wherefore ye are come?  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44010022-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44010022-1">22 </span> And they said, Cornelius the centurion, a just man, and one that feareth God, and of good report among all the nation of the Jews, was warned from God by an holy angel to send for thee into his house, and to hear words of thee.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44010023-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44010023-1">23 </span> Then called he them in, and lodged <span class="add">them</span>. And on the morrow Peter went away with them, and certain brethren from Joppa accompanied him.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44010024-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44010024-1">24 </span> And the morrow after they entered into Cæsarea.

Now therefore are we all here present before God, to hear all things that are commanded thee of God. </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt44010034-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44010034-1">34 </span>¶ Then Peter opened <span class="add">his</span> mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons:  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44010035-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44010035-1">35 </span> But in every nation he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44010036-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44010036-1">36 </span> The word which <span class="add">God</span> sent unto the children of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ: (he is Lord of all:)  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44010037-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44010037-1">37 </span> That word, <span class="add">I say</span>, ye know, which was published throughout all Judæa, and began from Galilee, after the baptism which John preached;  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44010038-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44010038-1">38 </span> How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth  with the Holy Ghost and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44010039-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44010039-1">39 </span> And we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the land of the Jews, and in Jerusalem; whom they slew and hanged on a tree:  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44010040-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44010040-1">40 </span> Him God raised up the third day, and shewed him openly;  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44010041-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44010041-1">41 </span> Not to all the people, but unto witnesses chosen before of God, <span class="add">even</span> to us, who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44010042-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44010042-1">42 </span> And he commanded us to preach unto the people, and to testify that it is he which was ordained of God <span class="add">to be</span> the Judge of quick and dead.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44010043-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44010043-1">43 </span> To him give all the prophets witness, that through his name whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins. </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt44010044-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44010044-1">44 </span>¶ While Peter yet spake these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the word.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44010045-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44010045-1">45 </span> And they of the circumcision which believed were astonished, as many as came with Peter, because that on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44010046-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44010046-1">46 </span> For they heard them speak with tongues, and magnify God. Then answered Peter,  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44010047-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44010047-1">47 </span> Can any man forbid water, that these should not be baptized, which have received the Holy Ghost as well as we?  </span><span class="verse" id="vt44010048-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v44010048-1">48 </span> And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord. Then prayed they him to tarry certain days. </span></p>
