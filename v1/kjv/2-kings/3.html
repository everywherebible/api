And he said, I will go up: I <span class="add">am</span> as thou <span class="add">art</span>, my people as thy people, <span class="add">and</span> my horses as thy horses.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt12003008-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v12003008-1">8 </span> And he said, Which way shall we go up? And he answered, The way through the wilderness of Edom.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt12003009-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v12003009-1">9 </span> So the king of Israel went, and the king of Judah, and the king of Edom: and they fetched a compass of seven days’ journey: and there was no water for the host, and for the cattle that followed them.<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†</a>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt12003010-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v12003010-1">10 </span> And the king of Israel said, Alas! that the <span class="nd">LORD</span> hath called these three kings together, to deliver them into the hand of Moab!  </span><span class="verse" id="vt12003011-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v12003011-1">11 </span> But Jehoshaphat said, <span class="add">Is there</span> not here a prophet of the <span class="nd">LORD</span>, that we may enquire of the <span class="nd">LORD</span> by him? And one of the king of Israel’s servants answered and said, Here <span class="add">is</span> Elisha the son of Shaphat, which poured water on the hands of Elijah.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt12003012-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v12003012-1">12 </span> And Jehoshaphat said, The word of the <span class="nd">LORD</span> is with him. So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt12003013-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v12003013-1">13 </span> And Elisha said unto the king of Israel, What have I to do with thee? get thee to the prophets of thy father, and to the prophets of thy mother. And the king of Israel said unto him, Nay: for the <span class="nd">LORD</span> hath called these three kings together, to deliver them into the hand of Moab.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt12003014-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v12003014-1">14 </span> And Elisha said, <span class="add">As</span> the <span class="nd">LORD</span> of hosts liveth, before whom I stand, surely, were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, I would not look toward thee, nor see thee.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt12003015-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v12003015-1">15 </span> But now bring me a minstrel. And it came to pass, when the minstrel played, that the hand of the <span class="nd">LORD</span> came upon him.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt12003016-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v12003016-1">16 </span> And he said, Thus saith the <span class="nd">LORD</span>, Make this valley full of ditches.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt12003017-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v12003017-1">17 </span> For thus saith the <span class="nd">LORD</span>, Ye shall not see wind, neither shall ye see rain; yet that valley shall be filled with water, that ye may drink, both ye, and your cattle, and your beasts.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt12003018-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v12003018-1">18 </span>And this is <span class="add">but</span> a light thing in the sight of the <span class="nd">LORD</span>: he will deliver the Moabites also into your hand.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt12003019-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v12003019-1">19 </span> And ye shall smite every fenced city, and every choice city, and shall fell every good tree, and stop all wells of water, and mar every good piece of land with stones.<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡</a> </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt12003020-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v12003020-1">20 </span> And it came to pass in the morning, when the meat offering was offered, that, behold, there came water by the way of Edom, and the country was filled with water. </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt12003021-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v12003021-1">21 </span>¶ And when all the Moabites heard that the kings were come up to fight against them, they gathered all that were able to put on armour, and upward, and stood in the border.<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§</a><a href="#FN5" class="notemark">**</a>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt12003022-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v12003022-1">22 </span> And they rose up early in the morning, and the sun shone upon the water, and the Moabites saw the water on the other side <span class="add">as</span> red as blood:  </span><span class="verse" id="vt12003023-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v12003023-1">23 </span> And they said, This <span class="add">is</span> blood: the kings are surely slain, and they have smitten one another: now therefore, Moab, to the spoil.<a href="#FN6" class="notemark">††</a>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt12003024-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v12003024-1">24 </span> And when they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up and smote the Moabites, so that they fled before them: but they went forward smiting the Moabites, even in <span class="add">their</span> country.<a href="#FN7" class="notemark">‡‡</a>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt12003025-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v12003025-1">25 </span> And they beat down the cities, and on every good piece of land cast every man his stone, and filled it; and they stopped all the wells of water, and felled all the good trees: only in Kir-haraseth left they the stones thereof; howbeit the slingers went about <span class="add">it</span>, and smote it.<a href="#FN8" class="notemark">§§</a> </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt12003026-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v12003026-1">26 </span>¶ And when the king of Moab saw that the battle was too sore for him, he took with him seven hundred men that drew swords, to break through <span class="add">even</span> unto the king of Edom: but they could not.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt12003027-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v12003027-1">27 </span> Then he took his eldest son that should have reigned in his stead, and offered him <span class="add">for</span> a burnt offering upon the wall. And there was great indignation against Israel: and they departed from him, and returned to <span class="add">their own</span> land. </span></p>
