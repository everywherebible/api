Then open the door, and flee, and tarry not. </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt12009004-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v12009004-1">4 </span>¶ So the young man, <span class="add">even</span> the young man the prophet, went to Ramoth-gilead.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt12009005-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v12009005-1">5 </span> And when he came, behold, the captains of the host <span class="add">were</span> sitting; and he said, I have an errand to thee, O captain. And Jehu said, Unto which of all us? And he said, To thee, O captain.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt12009006-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v12009006-1">6 </span> And he arose, and went into the house; and he poured the oil on his head, and said unto him, Thus saith the <span class="nd">LORD</span> God of Israel, I have anointed thee king over the people of the <span class="nd">LORD</span>, <span class="add">even</span> over Israel.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt12009007-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v12009007-1">7 </span> And thou shalt smite the house of Ahab thy master, that I may avenge the blood of my servants the prophets, and the blood of all the servants of the <span class="nd">LORD</span>, at the hand of Jezebel.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt12009008-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v12009008-1">8 </span> For the whole house of Ahab shall perish: and I will cut off from Ahab him that pisseth against the wall, and him that is shut up and left in Israel:  </span><span class="verse" id="vt12009009-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v12009009-1">9 </span> And I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah:  </span><span class="verse" id="vt12009010-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v12009010-1">10 </span> And the dogs shall eat Jezebel in the portion of Jezreel, and <span class="add">there shall be</span> none to bury <span class="add">her</span>.

And Jehu said, If it be your minds, <span class="add">then</span> let none go forth <span class="add">nor</span> escape out of the city to go to tell <span class="add">it</span> in Jezreel.<a href="#FN3" class="footnote">‡</a><a href="#FN4" class="footnote">§</a><a href="#FN5" class="footnote">**</a> </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt12009016-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v12009016-1">16 </span> So Jehu rode in a chariot, and went to Jezreel; for Joram lay there.

And Joram said, Take an horseman, and send to meet them, and let him say, <span class="add">Is it</span> peace?  </span><span class="verse" id="vt12009018-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v12009018-1">18 </span> So there went one on horseback to meet him, and said, Thus saith the king, <span class="add">Is it</span> peace? And Jehu said, What hast thou to do with peace? turn thee behind me. And the watchman told, saying, The messenger came to them, but he cometh not again.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt12009019-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v12009019-1">19 </span> Then he sent out a second on horseback, which came to them, and said, Thus saith the king, <span class="add">Is it</span> peace? And Jehu answered, What hast thou to do with peace? turn thee behind me.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt12009020-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v12009020-1">20 </span> And the watchman told, saying, He came even unto them, and cometh not again: and the driving <span class="add">is</span> like the driving of Jehu the son of Nimshi; for he driveth furiously.<a href="#FN6" class="footnote">††</a><a href="#FN7" class="footnote">‡‡</a>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt12009021-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v12009021-1">21 </span> And Joram said, Make ready. And his chariot was made ready. And Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah went out, each in his chariot, and they went out against Jehu, and met him in the portion of Naboth the Jezreelite.<a href="#FN8" class="footnote">§§</a><a href="#FN9" class="footnote">***</a>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt12009022-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v12009022-1">22 </span> And it came to pass, when Joram saw Jehu, that he said, <span class="add">Is it</span> peace, Jehu? And he answered, What peace, so long as the whoredoms of thy mother Jezebel and her witchcrafts <span class="add">are so</span> many?  </span><span class="verse" id="vt12009023-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v12009023-1">23 </span> And Joram turned his hands, and fled, and said to Ahaziah, <span class="add">There is</span> treachery, O Ahaziah.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt12009024-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v12009024-1">24 </span> And Jehu drew a bow with his full strength, and smote Jehoram between his arms, and the arrow went out at his heart, and he sunk down in his chariot.<a href="#FN10" class="footnote">†††</a><a href="#FN11" class="footnote">‡‡‡</a>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt12009025-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v12009025-1">25 </span> Then said <span class="add">Jehu</span> to Bidkar his captain, Take up, <span class="add">and</span> cast him in the portion of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite: for remember how that, when I and thou rode together after Ahab his father, the <span class="nd">LORD</span> laid this burden upon him;  </span><span class="verse" id="vt12009026-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v12009026-1">26 </span> Surely I have seen yesterday the blood of Naboth, and the blood of his sons, saith the <span class="nd">LORD</span>; and I will requite thee in this plat, saith the <span class="nd">LORD</span>.

And Jehu followed after him, and said, Smite him also in the chariot. <span class="add">And they did so</span> at the going up to Gur, which <span class="add">is</span> by Ibleam. And he fled to Megiddo, and died there.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt12009028-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v12009028-1">28 </span> And his servants carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem, and buried him in his sepulchre with his fathers in the city of David.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt12009029-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v12009029-1">29 </span> And in the eleventh year of Joram the son of Ahab began Ahaziah to reign over Judah. </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt12009030-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v12009030-1">30 </span>¶ And when Jehu was come to Jezreel, Jezebel heard <span class="add">of it;</span> and she painted her face, and tired her head, and looked out at a window.<a href="#FN14" class="footnote">†</a>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt12009031-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v12009031-1">31 </span> And as Jehu entered in at the gate, she said, <span class="add">Had</span> Zimri peace, who slew his master?  </span><span class="verse" id="vt12009032-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v12009032-1">32 </span> And he lifted up his face to the window, and said, Who <span class="add">is</span> on my side? who?
