 </span><span class="verse" id="vt48004010-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v48004010-1">10 </span> Ye observe days, and months, and times, and years.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt48004011-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v48004011-1">11 </span> I am afraid of you, lest I have bestowed upon you labour in vain. </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt48004012-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v48004012-1">12 </span> Brethren, I beseech you, be as I <span class="add">am</span>; for I <span class="add">am</span> as ye <span class="add">are</span>: ye have not injured me at all.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt48004013-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v48004013-1">13 </span> Ye know how through infirmity of the flesh I preached the gospel unto you at the first.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt48004014-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v48004014-1">14 </span> And my temptation which was in my flesh ye despised not, nor rejected; but received me as an angel of God, <span class="add">even</span> as Christ Jesus.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt48004015-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v48004015-1">15 </span> Where is then the blessedness ye spake of? for I bear you record, that, if <span class="add">it had been</span> possible, ye would have plucked out your own eyes, and have given them to me.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt48004016-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v48004016-1">16 </span> Am I therefore become your enemy, because I tell you the truth?  </span><span class="verse" id="vt48004017-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v48004017-1">17 </span> They zealously affect you, <span class="add">but</span> not well; yea, they would exclude you, that ye might affect them.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt48004018-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v48004018-1">18 </span> But <span class="add">it is</span> good to be zealously affected always in <span class="add">a</span> good <span class="add">thing</span>, and not only when I am present with you.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt48004019-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v48004019-1">19 </span> My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you,  </span><span class="verse" id="vt48004020-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v48004020-1">20 </span> I desire to be present with you now, and to change my voice; for I stand in doubt of you. </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt48004021-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v48004021-1">21 </span> Tell me, ye that desire to be under the law, do ye not hear the law?  </span><span class="verse" id="vt48004022-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v48004022-1">22 </span> For it is written, that Abraham had two sons, the one by a bondmaid, the other by a freewoman.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt48004023-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v48004023-1">23 </span> But he <span class="add">who was</span> of the bondwoman was born after the flesh; but he of the freewoman <span class="add">was</span> by promise.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt48004024-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v48004024-1">24 </span> Which things are an allegory: for these are the two covenants; the one from the mount Sinai, which gendereth to bondage, which is Agar.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt48004025-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v48004025-1">25 </span> For this Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and answereth to Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt48004026-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v48004026-1">26 </span> But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us all.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt48004027-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v48004027-1">27 </span> For it is written, Rejoice, <span class="add">thou</span> barren that bearest not; break forth and cry, thou that travailest not: for the desolate hath many more children than she which hath an husband.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt48004028-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v48004028-1">28 </span> Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt48004029-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v48004029-1">29 </span> But as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him <span class="add">that was born</span> after the Spirit, even so <span class="add">it is</span> now.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt48004030-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v48004030-1">30 </span> Nevertheless what saith the scripture? Cast out the bondwoman and her son: for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the freewoman.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt48004031-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v48004031-1">31 </span> So then, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman, but of the free. </span></p>
