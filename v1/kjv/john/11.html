It was a cave, and a stone lay upon it.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43011039-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43011039-1">39 </span> Jesus said, <span class="woc"> Take ye away the stone.</span> Martha, the sister of him that was dead, saith unto him, Lord, by this time he stinketh: for he hath been <span class="add">dead</span> four days.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43011040-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43011040-1">40 </span> Jesus saith unto her, <span class="woc"> Said I not unto thee, that, if thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God?</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43011041-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43011041-1">41 </span> Then they took away the stone <span class="add">from the place</span> where the dead was laid. And Jesus lifted up <span class="add">his</span> eyes, and said, <span class="woc"> Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me.</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43011042-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43011042-1">42 </span> <span class="woc"> And I knew that thou hearest me always: but because of the people which stand by I said <span class="add">it</span>, that they may believe that thou hast sent me.</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43011043-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43011043-1">43 </span> And when he thus had spoken, he cried with a loud voice, <span class="woc"> Lazarus, come forth.</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43011044-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43011044-1">44 </span> And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with graveclothes: and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus saith unto them, <span class="woc"> Loose him, and let him go.</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43011045-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43011045-1">45 </span> Then many of the Jews which came to Mary, and had seen the things which Jesus did, believed on him.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43011046-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43011046-1">46 </span> But some of them went their ways to the Pharisees, and told them what things Jesus had done. </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt43011047-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43011047-1">47 </span>¶ Then gathered the chief priests and the Pharisees a council, and said, What do we? for this man doeth many miracles.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43011048-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43011048-1">48 </span> If we let him thus alone, all <span class="add">men</span> will believe on him: and the Romans shall come and take away both our place and nation.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43011049-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43011049-1">49 </span> And one of them, <span class="add">named</span> Caiaphas, being the high priest that same year, said unto them, Ye know nothing at all,  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43011050-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43011050-1">50 </span> Nor consider that it is expedient for us, that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43011051-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43011051-1">51 </span> And this spake he not of himself: but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for that nation;  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43011052-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43011052-1">52 </span> And not for that nation only, but that also he should gather together in one the children of God that were scattered abroad.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43011053-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43011053-1">53 </span> Then from that day forth they took counsel together for to put him to death.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43011054-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43011054-1">54 </span> Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews; but went thence unto a country near to the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim, and there continued with his disciples. </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt43011055-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43011055-1">55 </span>¶ And the Jews’ passover was nigh at hand: and many went out of the country up to Jerusalem before the passover, to purify themselves.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43011056-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43011056-1">56 </span> Then sought they for Jesus, and spake among themselves, as they stood in the temple, What think ye, that he will not come to the feast?  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43011057-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43011057-1">57 </span> Now both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a commandment, that, if any man knew where he were, he should shew <span class="add">it</span>, that they might take him. </span></p>
