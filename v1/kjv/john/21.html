<p> <span class="verse" id="vt43021001-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43021001-1">1 </span> After these things Jesus shewed himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias; and on this wise shewed he <span class="add">himself</span>.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43021002-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43021002-1">2 </span> There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the <span class="add">sons</span> of Zebedee, and two other of his disciples.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43021003-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43021003-1">3 </span> Simon Peter saith unto them, I go a fishing. They say unto him, We also go with thee. They went forth, and entered into a ship immediately; and that night they caught nothing.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43021004-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43021004-1">4 </span> But when the morning was now come, Jesus stood on the shore: but the disciples knew not that it was Jesus.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43021005-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43021005-1">5 </span> Then Jesus saith unto them, <span class="woc"> Children, have ye any meat?</span> They answered him, No.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43021006-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43021006-1">6 </span> And he said unto them, <span class="woc"> Cast the net on the right side of the ship, and ye shall find.</span> They cast therefore, and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43021007-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43021007-1">7 </span> Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved saith unto Peter, It is the Lord. Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girt <span class="add">his</span> fisher’s coat <span class="add">unto him</span>, (for he was naked,) and did cast himself into the sea.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43021008-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43021008-1">8 </span> And the other disciples came in a little ship; (for they were not far from land, but as it were two hundred cubits,) dragging the net with fishes.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43021009-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43021009-1">9 </span> As soon then as they were come to land, they saw a fire of coals there, and fish laid thereon, and bread.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43021010-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43021010-1">10 </span> Jesus saith unto them, <span class="woc"> Bring of the fish which ye have now caught.</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43021011-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43021011-1">11 </span> Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to land full of great fishes, an hundred and fifty and three: and for all there were so many, yet was not the net broken.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43021012-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43021012-1">12 </span> Jesus saith unto them, <span class="woc"> Come <span class="add">and</span> dine.</span> And none of the disciples durst ask him, Who art thou? knowing that it was the Lord.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43021013-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43021013-1">13 </span> Jesus then cometh, and taketh bread, and giveth them, and fish likewise.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43021014-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43021014-1">14 </span> This is now the third time that Jesus shewed himself to his disciples, after that he was risen from the dead. </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt43021015-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43021015-1">15 </span>¶ So when they had dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, <span class="woc"> Simon, <span class="add">son</span> of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these?</span> He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, <span class="woc"> Feed my lambs.</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43021016-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43021016-1">16 </span> He saith to him again the second time, <span class="woc"> Simon, <span class="add">son</span> of Jonas, lovest thou me?</span> He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, <span class="woc"> Feed my sheep.</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43021017-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43021017-1">17 </span> He saith unto him the third time, <span class="woc"> Simon, <span class="add">son</span> of Jonas, lovest thou me?</span> Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time, Lovest thou me? And he said unto him, Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith unto him, <span class="woc"> Feed my sheep.</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43021018-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43021018-1">18 </span> <span class="woc"> Verily, verily, I say unto thee, When thou wast young, thou girdedst thyself, and walkedst whither thou wouldest: but when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and carry <span class="add">thee</span> whither thou wouldest not.</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43021019-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43021019-1">19 </span> This spake he, signifying by what death he should glorify God. And when he had spoken this, he saith unto him, <span class="woc"> Follow me.</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43021020-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43021020-1">20 </span> Then Peter, turning about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved following; which also leaned on his breast at supper, and said, Lord, which is he that betrayeth thee?  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43021021-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43021021-1">21 </span> Peter seeing him saith to Jesus, Lord, and what <span class="add">shall</span> this man <span class="add">do</span>?  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43021022-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43021022-1">22 </span> Jesus saith unto him, <span class="woc"> If I will that he tarry till I come, what <span class="add">is that</span> to thee? follow thou me.</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43021023-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43021023-1">23 </span> Then went this saying abroad among the brethren, that that disciple should not die: yet Jesus said not unto him, He shall not die; but, If I will that he tarry till I come, what <span class="add">is that</span> to thee?  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43021024-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43021024-1">24 </span> This is the disciple which testifieth of these things, and wrote these things: and we know that his testimony is true.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43021025-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43021025-1">25 </span> And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which, if they should be written every one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written. Amen. </span></p>
