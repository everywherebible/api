<p> <span class="verse" id="vt43004001-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43004001-1">1 </span> When therefore the Lord knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John,  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43004002-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43004002-1">2 </span>(Though Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples,)  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43004003-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43004003-1">3 </span> He left Judæa, and departed again into Galilee.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43004004-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43004004-1">4 </span> And he must needs go through Samaria.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43004005-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43004005-1">5 </span> Then cometh he to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43004006-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43004006-1">6 </span> Now Jacob’s well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with <span class="add">his</span> journey, sat thus on the well: <span class="add">and</span> it was about the sixth hour.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43004007-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43004007-1">7 </span> There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith unto her, <span class="wj"> Give me to drink.</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43004008-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43004008-1">8 </span>(For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat.)  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43004009-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43004009-1">9 </span> Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria? for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43004010-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43004010-1">10 </span> Jesus answered and said unto her, <span class="wj"> If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43004011-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43004011-1">11 </span> The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: from whence then hast thou that living water?  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43004012-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43004012-1">12 </span> Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle?  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43004013-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43004013-1">13 </span> Jesus answered and said unto her, <span class="wj"> Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again:</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43004014-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43004014-1">14 </span> <span class="wj"> But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43004015-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43004015-1">15 </span> The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come hither to draw.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43004016-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43004016-1">16 </span> Jesus saith unto her, <span class="wj"> Go, call thy husband, and come hither.</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43004017-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43004017-1">17 </span> The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said unto her, <span class="wj"> Thou hast well said, I have no husband:</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43004018-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43004018-1">18 </span> <span class="wj"> For thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband: in that saidst thou truly.</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43004019-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43004019-1">19 </span> The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43004020-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43004020-1">20 </span> Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43004021-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43004021-1">21 </span> Jesus saith unto her, <span class="wj"> Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father.</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43004022-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43004022-1">22 </span> <span class="wj"> Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews.</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43004023-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43004023-1">23 </span> <span class="wj"> But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him.</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43004024-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43004024-1">24 </span> <span class="wj"> God <span class="add">is</span> a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship <span class="add">him</span> in spirit and in truth.</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43004025-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43004025-1">25 </span> The woman saith unto him, I know that Messias cometh, which is called Christ: when he is come, he will tell us all things.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43004026-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43004026-1">26 </span> Jesus saith unto her, <span class="wj"> I that speak unto thee am <span class="add">he.</span></span> </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt43004027-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43004027-1">27 </span>¶ And upon this came his disciples, and marvelled that he talked with the woman: yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why talkest thou with her?  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43004028-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43004028-1">28 </span> The woman then left her waterpot, and went her way into the city, and saith to the men,  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43004029-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43004029-1">29 </span> Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ?  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43004030-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43004030-1">30 </span> Then they went out of the city, and came unto him. </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt43004031-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43004031-1">31 </span>¶ In the mean while his disciples prayed him, saying, Master, eat.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43004032-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43004032-1">32 </span> But he said unto them, <span class="wj"> I have meat to eat that ye know not of.</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43004033-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43004033-1">33 </span> Therefore said the disciples one to another, Hath any man brought him <span class="add">ought</span> to eat?  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43004034-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43004034-1">34 </span> Jesus saith unto them, <span class="wj"> My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work.</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43004035-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43004035-1">35 </span> <span class="wj"> Say not ye, There are yet four months, and <span class="add">then</span> cometh harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest.</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43004036-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43004036-1">36 </span> <span class="wj"> And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal: that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together.</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43004037-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43004037-1">37 </span> <span class="wj"> And herein is that saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth.</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43004038-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43004038-1">38 </span> <span class="wj"> I sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour: other men laboured, and ye are entered into their labours.</span> </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt43004039-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43004039-1">39 </span>¶ And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman, which testified, He told me all that ever I did.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43004040-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43004040-1">40 </span> So when the Samaritans were come unto him, they besought him that he would tarry with them: and he abode there two days.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43004041-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43004041-1">41 </span> And many more believed because of his own word;  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43004042-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43004042-1">42 </span> And said unto the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy saying: for we have heard <span class="add">him</span> ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world. </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt43004043-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43004043-1">43 </span>¶ Now after two days he departed thence, and went into Galilee.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43004044-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43004044-1">44 </span> For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honour in his own country.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43004045-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43004045-1">45 </span> Then when he was come into Galilee, the Galilæans received him, having seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went unto the feast.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43004046-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43004046-1">46 </span> So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43004047-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43004047-1">47 </span> When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judæa into Galilee, he went unto him, and besought him that he would come down, and heal his son: for he was at the point of death.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43004048-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43004048-1">48 </span> Then said Jesus unto him, <span class="wj"> Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe.</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43004049-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43004049-1">49 </span> The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43004050-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43004050-1">50 </span> Jesus saith unto him, <span class="wj"> Go thy way; thy son liveth.</span> And the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him, and he went his way.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43004051-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43004051-1">51 </span> And as he was now going down, his servants met him, and told <span class="add">him</span>, saying, Thy son liveth.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43004052-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43004052-1">52 </span> Then enquired he of them the hour when he began to amend. And they said unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43004053-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43004053-1">53 </span> So the father knew that <span class="add">it was</span> at the same hour, in the which Jesus said unto him, Thy son liveth: and himself believed, and his whole house.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43004054-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43004054-1">54 </span> This <span class="add">is</span> again the second miracle <span class="add">that</span> Jesus did, when he was come out of Judæa into Galilee. </span></p>
