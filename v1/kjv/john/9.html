<p> <span class="verse" id="vt43009001-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43009001-1">1 </span> And as <span class="add">Jesus</span> passed by, he saw a man which was blind from <span class="add">his</span> birth.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43009002-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43009002-1">2 </span> And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind?  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43009003-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43009003-1">3 </span> Jesus answered, <span class="woc"> Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43009004-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43009004-1">4 </span> <span class="woc"> I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work.</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43009005-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43009005-1">5 </span> <span class="woc"> As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43009006-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43009006-1">6 </span> When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay,  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43009007-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43009007-1">7 </span> And said unto him, <span class="woc"> Go, wash in the pool of Siloam,</span> (which is by interpretation, Sent.) He went his way therefore, and washed, and came seeing. </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt43009008-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43009008-1">8 </span>¶ The neighbours therefore, and they which before had seen him that he was blind, said, Is not this he that sat and begged?  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43009009-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43009009-1">9 </span> Some said, This is he: others <span class="add">said</span>, He is like him: <span class="add">but</span> he said, I am <span class="add">he</span>.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43009010-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43009010-1">10 </span> Therefore said they unto him, How were thine eyes opened?  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43009011-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43009011-1">11 </span> He answered and said, A man that is called Jesus made clay, and anointed mine eyes, and said unto me, Go to the pool of Siloam, and wash: and I went and washed, and I received sight.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43009012-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43009012-1">12 </span> Then said they unto him, Where is he? He said, I know not. </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt43009013-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43009013-1">13 </span>¶ They brought to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43009014-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43009014-1">14 </span> And it was the sabbath day when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43009015-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43009015-1">15 </span> Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. He said unto them, He put clay upon mine eyes, and I washed, and do see.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43009016-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43009016-1">16 </span> Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not of God, because he keepeth not the sabbath day. Others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a division among them.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43009017-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43009017-1">17 </span> They say unto the blind man again, What sayest thou of him, that he hath opened thine eyes? He said, He is a prophet.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43009018-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43009018-1">18 </span> But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had received his sight.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43009019-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43009019-1">19 </span> And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say was born blind? how then doth he now see?  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43009020-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43009020-1">20 </span> His parents answered them and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind:  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43009021-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43009021-1">21 </span> But by what means he now seeth, we know not; or who hath opened his eyes, we know not: he is of age; ask him: he shall speak for himself.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43009022-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43009022-1">22 </span> These <span class="add">words</span> spake his parents, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man did confess that he was Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43009023-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43009023-1">23 </span> Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43009024-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43009024-1">24 </span> Then again called they the man that was blind, and said unto him, Give God the praise: we know that this man is a sinner.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43009025-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43009025-1">25 </span> He answered and said, Whether he be a sinner <span class="add">or no</span>, I know not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43009026-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43009026-1">26 </span> Then said they to him again, What did he to thee? how opened he thine eyes?  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43009027-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43009027-1">27 </span> He answered them, I have told you already, and ye did not hear: wherefore would ye hear <span class="add">it</span> again? will ye also be his disciples?  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43009028-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43009028-1">28 </span> Then they reviled him, and said, Thou art his disciple; but we are Moses’ disciples.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43009029-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43009029-1">29 </span> We know that God spake unto Moses: <span class="add">as for</span> this <span class="add">fellow</span>, we know not from whence he is.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43009030-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43009030-1">30 </span> The man answered and said unto them, Why herein is a marvellous thing, that ye know not from whence he is, and <span class="add">yet</span> he hath opened mine eyes.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43009031-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43009031-1">31 </span> Now we know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of God, and doeth his will, him he heareth.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43009032-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43009032-1">32 </span> Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43009033-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43009033-1">33 </span> If this man were not of God, he could do nothing.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43009034-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43009034-1">34 </span> They answered and said unto him, Thou wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43009035-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43009035-1">35 </span> Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found him, he said unto him, <span class="woc"> Dost thou believe on the Son of God?</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43009036-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43009036-1">36 </span> He answered and said, Who is he, Lord, that I might believe on him?  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43009037-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43009037-1">37 </span> And Jesus said unto him, <span class="woc"> Thou hast both seen him, and it is he that talketh with thee.</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43009038-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43009038-1">38 </span> And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him. </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt43009039-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43009039-1">39 </span>¶ And Jesus said, <span class="woc"> For judgment I am come into this world, that they which see not might see; and that they which see might be made blind.</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43009040-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43009040-1">40 </span> And <span class="add">some</span> of the Pharisees which were with him heard these words, and said unto him, Are we blind also?  </span><span class="verse" id="vt43009041-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v43009041-1">41 </span> Jesus said unto them, <span class="woc"> If ye were blind, ye should have no sin: but now ye say, We see; therefore your sin remaineth.</span> </span></p>
