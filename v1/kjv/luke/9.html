And he took them, and went aside privately into a desert place belonging to the city called Bethsaida.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt42009011-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v42009011-1">11 </span> And the people, when they knew <span class="add">it</span>, followed him: and he received them, and spake unto them of the kingdom of God, and healed them that had need of healing.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt42009012-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v42009012-1">12 </span> And when the day began to wear away, then came the twelve, and said unto him, Send the multitude away, that they may go into the towns and country round about, and lodge, and get victuals: for we are here in a desert place.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt42009013-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v42009013-1">13 </span> But he said unto them, <span class="wj"> Give ye them to eat.</span> And they said, We have no more but five loaves and two fishes; except we should go and buy meat for all this people.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt42009014-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v42009014-1">14 </span> For they were about five thousand men.

one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias: not knowing what he said.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt42009034-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v42009034-1">34 </span> While he thus spake, there came a cloud, and overshadowed them: and they feared as they entered into the cloud.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt42009035-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v42009035-1">35 </span> And there came a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son: hear him.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt42009036-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v42009036-1">36 </span> And when the voice was past, Jesus was found alone. And they kept it close, and told no man in those days any of those things which they had seen. </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt42009037-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v42009037-1">37 </span>¶ And it came to pass, that on the next day, when they were come down from the hill, much people met him.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt42009038-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v42009038-1">38 </span> And, behold, a man of the company cried out, saying, Master, I beseech thee, look upon my son: for he is mine only child.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt42009039-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v42009039-1">39 </span> And, lo, a spirit taketh him, and he suddenly crieth out; and it teareth him that he foameth again, and bruising him hardly departeth from him.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt42009040-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v42009040-1">40 </span> And I besought thy disciples to cast him out; and they could not.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt42009041-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v42009041-1">41 </span> And Jesus answering said, <span class="wj"> O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you, and suffer you? Bring thy son hither.</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt42009042-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v42009042-1">42 </span> And as he was yet a coming, the devil threw him down, and tare <span class="add">him</span>. And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the child, and delivered him again to his father. </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt42009043-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v42009043-1">43 </span>¶ And they were all amazed at the mighty power of God. But while they wondered every one at all things which Jesus did, he said unto his disciples,  </span><span class="verse" id="vt42009044-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v42009044-1">44 </span> <span class="wj"> Let these sayings sink down into your ears: for the Son of man shall be delivered into the hands of men.</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt42009045-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v42009045-1">45 </span> But they understood not this saying, and it was hid from them, that they perceived it not: and they feared to ask him of that saying. </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt42009046-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v42009046-1">46 </span>¶ Then there arose a reasoning among them, which of them should be greatest.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt42009047-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v42009047-1">47 </span> And Jesus, perceiving the thought of their heart, took a child, and set him by him,  </span><span class="verse" id="vt42009048-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v42009048-1">48 </span> And said unto them, <span class="wj"> Whosoever shall receive this child in my name receiveth me: and whosoever shall receive me receiveth him that sent me: for he that is least among you all, the same shall be great.</span> </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt42009049-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v42009049-1">49 </span>¶ And John answered and said, Master, we saw one casting out devils in thy name; and we forbad him, because he followeth not with us.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt42009050-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v42009050-1">50 </span> And Jesus said unto him, <span class="wj"> Forbid <span class="add">him</span> not: for he that is not against us is for us.</span> </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt42009051-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v42009051-1">51 </span>¶ And it came to pass, when the time was come that he should be received up, he stedfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem,  </span><span class="verse" id="vt42009052-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v42009052-1">52 </span> And sent messengers before his face: and they went, and entered into a village of the Samaritans, to make ready for him.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt42009053-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v42009053-1">53 </span> And they did not receive him, because his face was as though he would go to Jerusalem.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt42009054-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v42009054-1">54 </span> And when his disciples James and John saw <span class="add">this</span>, they said, Lord, wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven, and consume them, even as Elias did?  </span><span class="verse" id="vt42009055-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v42009055-1">55 </span> But he turned, and rebuked them, and said, <span class="wj"> Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of.</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt42009056-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v42009056-1">56 </span> <span class="wj"> For the Son of man is not come to destroy men’s lives, but to save <span class="add">them</span>. And they went to another village.</span> </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt42009057-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v42009057-1">57 </span>¶ And it came to pass, that, as they went in the way, a certain <span class="add">man</span> said unto him, Lord, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt42009058-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v42009058-1">58 </span> And Jesus said unto him, <span class="wj"> Foxes have holes, and birds of the air <span class="add">have</span> nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay <span class="add">his</span> head.</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt42009059-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v42009059-1">59 </span> And he said unto another, <span class="wj"> Follow me.</span> But he said, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt42009060-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v42009060-1">60 </span> Jesus said unto him, <span class="wj"> Let the dead bury their dead: but go thou and preach the kingdom of God.</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt42009061-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v42009061-1">61 </span> And another also said, Lord, I will follow thee; but let me first go bid them farewell, which are at home at my house.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt42009062-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v42009062-1">62 </span> And Jesus said unto him, <span class="wj"> No man, having put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.</span> </span></p>
