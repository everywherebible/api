<p> <span class="verse" id="vt42005001-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v42005001-1">1 </span> And it came to pass, that, as the people pressed upon him to hear the word of God, he stood by the lake of Gennesaret,  </span><span class="verse" id="vt42005002-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v42005002-1">2 </span> And saw two ships standing by the lake: but the fishermen were gone out of them, and were washing <span class="add">their</span> nets.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt42005003-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v42005003-1">3 </span> And he entered into one of the ships, which was Simon’s, and prayed him that he would thrust out a little from the land. And he sat down, and taught the people out of the ship.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt42005004-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v42005004-1">4 </span> Now when he had left speaking, he said unto Simon, <span class="wj"> Launch out into the deep, and let down your nets for a draught.</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt42005005-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v42005005-1">5 </span> And Simon answering said unto him, Master, we have toiled all the night, and have taken nothing: nevertheless at thy word I will let down the net.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt42005006-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v42005006-1">6 </span> And when they had this done, they inclosed a great multitude of fishes: and their net brake.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt42005007-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v42005007-1">7 </span> And they beckoned unto <span class="add">their</span> partners, which were in the other ship, that they should come and help them. And they came, and filled both the ships, so that they began to sink.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt42005008-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v42005008-1">8 </span> When Simon Peter saw <span class="add">it</span>, he fell down at Jesus’ knees, saying, Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt42005009-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v42005009-1">9 </span> For he was astonished, and all that were with him, at the draught of the fishes which they had taken:  </span><span class="verse" id="vt42005010-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v42005010-1">10 </span> And so <span class="add">was</span> also James, and John, the sons of Zebedee, which were partners with Simon. And Jesus said unto Simon, <span class="wj"> Fear not; from henceforth thou shalt catch men.</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt42005011-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v42005011-1">11 </span> And when they had brought their ships to land, they forsook all, and followed him. </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt42005012-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v42005012-1">12 </span>¶ And it came to pass, when he was in a certain city, behold a man full of leprosy: who seeing Jesus fell on <span class="add">his</span> face, and besought him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt42005013-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v42005013-1">13 </span> And he put forth <span class="add">his</span> hand, and touched him, saying, <span class="wj"> I will: be thou clean.</span> And immediately the leprosy departed from him.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt42005014-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v42005014-1">14 </span> And he charged him to tell no man: <span class="wj"> but go, and shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing, according as Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt42005015-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v42005015-1">15 </span> But so much the more went there a fame abroad of him: and great multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed by him of their infirmities. </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt42005016-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v42005016-1">16 </span>¶ And he withdrew himself into the wilderness, and prayed.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt42005017-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v42005017-1">17 </span> And it came to pass on a certain day, as he was teaching, that there were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by, which were come out of every town of Galilee, and Judæa, and Jerusalem: and the power of the Lord was <span class="add">present</span> to heal them. </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt42005018-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v42005018-1">18 </span>¶ And, behold, men brought in a bed a man which was taken with a palsy: and they sought <span class="add">means</span> to bring him in, and to lay <span class="add">him</span> before him.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt42005019-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v42005019-1">19 </span> And when they could not find by what <span class="add">way</span> they might bring him in because of the multitude, they went upon the housetop, and let him down through the tiling with <span class="add">his</span> couch into the midst before Jesus.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt42005020-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v42005020-1">20 </span> And when he saw their faith, he said unto him, <span class="wj"> Man, thy sins are forgiven thee.</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt42005021-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v42005021-1">21 </span> And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, Who is this which speaketh blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone?  </span><span class="verse" id="vt42005022-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v42005022-1">22 </span> But when Jesus perceived their thoughts, he answering said unto them, <span class="wj"> What reason ye in your hearts?</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt42005023-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v42005023-1">23 </span> <span class="wj"> Whether is easier, to say, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Rise up and walk?</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt42005024-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v42005024-1">24 </span> <span class="wj"> But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power upon earth to forgive sins,</span> (he said unto the sick of the palsy,) <span class="wj"> I say unto thee, Arise, and take up thy couch, and go into thine house.</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt42005025-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v42005025-1">25 </span> And immediately he rose up before them, and took up that whereon he lay, and departed to his own house, glorifying God.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt42005026-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v42005026-1">26 </span> And they were all amazed, and they glorified God, and were filled with fear, saying, We have seen strange things to day. </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt42005027-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v42005027-1">27 </span>¶ And after these things he went forth, and saw a publican, named Levi, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he said unto him, <span class="wj"> Follow me.</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt42005028-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v42005028-1">28 </span> And he left all, rose up, and followed him.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt42005029-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v42005029-1">29 </span> And Levi made him a great feast in his own house: and there was a great company of publicans and of others that sat down with them.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt42005030-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v42005030-1">30 </span> But their scribes and Pharisees murmured against his disciples, saying, Why do ye eat and drink with publicans and sinners?  </span><span class="verse" id="vt42005031-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v42005031-1">31 </span> And Jesus answering said unto them, <span class="wj"> They that are whole need not a physician; but they that are sick.</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt42005032-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v42005032-1">32 </span> <span class="wj"> I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.</span> </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt42005033-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v42005033-1">33 </span>¶ And they said unto him, Why do the disciples of John fast often, and make prayers, and likewise <span class="add">the disciples</span> of the Pharisees; but thine eat and drink?  </span><span class="verse" id="vt42005034-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v42005034-1">34 </span> And he said unto them, <span class="wj"> Can ye make the children of the bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them?</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt42005035-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v42005035-1">35 </span> <span class="wj"> But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then shall they fast in those days.</span> </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt42005036-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v42005036-1">36 </span>¶ And he spake also a parable unto them; <span class="wj"> No man putteth a piece of a new garment upon an old; if otherwise, then both the new maketh a rent, and the piece that was <span class="add">taken</span> out of the new agreeth not with the old.</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt42005037-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v42005037-1">37 </span> <span class="wj"> And no man putteth new wine into old bottles; else the new wine will burst the bottles, and be spilled, and the bottles shall perish.</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt42005038-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v42005038-1">38 </span> <span class="wj"> But new wine must be put into new bottles; and both are preserved.</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt42005039-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v42005039-1">39 </span> <span class="wj"> No man also having drunk old <span class="add">wine</span> straightway desireth new: for he saith, The old is better.</span> </span></p>
