And when he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying unto him, Lord, trouble not thyself: for I am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my roof:  </span><span class="verse" id="vt42007007-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v42007007-1">7 </span> Wherefore neither thought I myself worthy to come unto thee: but say in a word, and my servant shall be healed.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt42007008-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v42007008-1">8 </span> For I also am a man set under authority, having under me soldiers, and I say unto one, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth <span class="add">it</span>.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt42007009-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v42007009-1">9 </span> When Jesus heard these things, he marvelled at him, and turned him about, and said unto the people that followed him, <span class="woc"> I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt42007010-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v42007010-1">10 </span> And they that were sent, returning to the house, found the servant whole that had been sick. </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt42007011-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v42007011-1">11 </span>¶ And it came to pass the day after, that he went into a city called Nain; and many of his disciples went with him, and much people.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt42007012-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v42007012-1">12 </span> Now when he came nigh to the gate of the city, behold, there was a dead man carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow: and much people of the city was with her.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt42007013-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v42007013-1">13 </span> And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said unto her, <span class="woc"> Weep not.</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt42007014-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v42007014-1">14 </span> And he came and touched the bier: and they that bare <span class="add">him</span> stood still. And he said, <span class="woc"> Young man, I say unto thee, Arise.</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt42007015-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v42007015-1">15 </span> And he that was dead sat up, and began to speak. And he delivered him to his mother.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt42007016-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v42007016-1">16 </span> And there came a fear on all: and they glorified God, saying, That a great prophet is risen up among us; and, That God hath visited his people.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt42007017-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v42007017-1">17 </span> And this rumour of him went forth throughout all Judæa, and throughout all the region round about.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt42007018-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v42007018-1">18 </span> And the disciples of John shewed him of all these things. </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt42007019-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v42007019-1">19 </span>¶ And John calling <span class="add">unto him</span> two of his disciples sent <span class="add">them</span> to Jesus, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for another?  </span><span class="verse" id="vt42007020-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v42007020-1">20 </span> When the men were come unto him, they said, John Baptist hath sent us unto thee, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for another?  </span><span class="verse" id="vt42007021-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v42007021-1">21 </span> And in that same hour he cured many of <span class="add">their</span> infirmities and plagues, and of evil spirits; and unto many <span class="add">that were</span> blind he gave sight.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt42007022-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v42007022-1">22 </span> Then Jesus answering said unto them, <span class="woc"> Go your way, and tell John what things ye have seen and heard; how that the blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, to the poor the gospel is preached.</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt42007023-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v42007023-1">23 </span> <span class="woc"> And blessed is <span class="add">he</span>, whosoever shall not be offended in me.</span> </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt42007024-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v42007024-1">24 </span>¶ And when the messengers of John were departed, he began to speak unto the people concerning John, <span class="woc"> What went ye out into the wilderness for to see? A reed shaken with the wind?</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt42007025-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v42007025-1">25 </span> <span class="woc"> But what went ye out for to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? Behold, they which are gorgeously apparelled, and live delicately, are in kings’ courts.</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt42007026-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v42007026-1">26 </span> <span class="woc"> But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? Yea, I say unto you, and much more than a prophet.</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt42007027-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v42007027-1">27 </span> <span class="woc"> This is <span class="add">he</span>, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt42007028-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v42007028-1">28 </span> <span class="woc"> For I say unto you, Among those that are born of women there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist: but he that is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt42007029-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v42007029-1">29 </span> And all the people that heard <span class="add">him</span>, and the publicans, justified God, being baptized with the baptism of John.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt42007030-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v42007030-1">30 </span> But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of God against themselves, being not baptized of him. </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt42007031-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v42007031-1">31 </span>¶ And the Lord said, <span class="woc"> Whereunto then shall I liken the men of this generation? and to what are they like?</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt42007032-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v42007032-1">32 </span> <span class="woc"> They are like unto children sitting in the marketplace, and calling one to another, and saying, We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned to you, and ye have not wept.</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt42007033-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v42007033-1">33 </span> <span class="woc"> For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine; and ye say, He hath a devil.</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt42007034-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v42007034-1">34 </span> <span class="woc"> The Son of man is come eating and drinking; and ye say, Behold a gluttonous man, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners!</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt42007035-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v42007035-1">35 </span> <span class="woc"> But wisdom is justified of all her children.</span> </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt42007036-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v42007036-1">36 </span>¶ And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him.

And he said unto him, <span class="woc"> Thou hast rightly judged.</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt42007044-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v42007044-1">44 </span> And he turned to the woman, and said unto Simon, <span class="woc"> Seest thou this woman? I entered into thine house, thou gavest me no water for my feet: but she hath washed my feet with tears, and wiped <span class="add">them</span> with the hairs of her head.</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt42007045-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v42007045-1">45 </span> <span class="woc"> Thou gavest me no kiss: but this woman since the time I came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet.</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt42007046-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v42007046-1">46 </span> <span class="woc"> My head with oil thou didst not anoint: but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment.</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt42007047-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v42007047-1">47 </span> <span class="woc"> Wherefore I say unto thee, Her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven, <span class="add">the same</span> loveth little.</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt42007048-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v42007048-1">48 </span> And he said unto her, <span class="woc"> Thy sins are forgiven.</span>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt42007049-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v42007049-1">49 </span> And they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves, Who is this that forgiveth sins also?  </span><span class="verse" id="vt42007050-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v42007050-1">50 </span> And he said to the woman, <span class="woc"> Thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace.</span> </span></p>
