<p> <span class="verse" id="vt62004001-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v62004001-1">1 </span> Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt62004002-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v62004002-1">2 </span> Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God:  </span><span class="verse" id="vt62004003-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v62004003-1">3 </span> And every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God: and this is that <span class="add">spirit</span> of antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the world.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt62004004-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v62004004-1">4 </span> Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt62004005-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v62004005-1">5 </span> They are of the world: therefore speak they of the world, and the world heareth them.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt62004006-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v62004006-1">6 </span> We are of God: he that knoweth God heareth us; he that is not of God heareth not us. Hereby know we the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error. </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt62004007-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v62004007-1">7 </span> Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt62004008-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v62004008-1">8 </span> He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt62004009-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v62004009-1">9 </span> In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt62004010-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v62004010-1">10 </span> Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son <span class="add">to be</span> the propitiation for our sins.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt62004011-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v62004011-1">11 </span> Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt62004012-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v62004012-1">12 </span> No man hath seen God at any time. If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt62004013-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v62004013-1">13 </span> Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt62004014-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v62004014-1">14 </span> And we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son <span class="add">to be</span> the Saviour of the world.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt62004015-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v62004015-1">15 </span> Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt62004016-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v62004016-1">16 </span> And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt62004017-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v62004017-1">17 </span> Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt62004018-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v62004018-1">18 </span> There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt62004019-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v62004019-1">19 </span> We love him, because he first loved us.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt62004020-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v62004020-1">20 </span> If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen?  </span><span class="verse" id="vt62004021-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v62004021-1">21 </span> And this commandment have we from him, That he who loveth God love his brother also. </span></p>
