Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you? no, not one that shall be able to judge between his brethren?  </span><span class="verse" id="vt46006006-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v46006006-1">6 </span> But brother goeth to law with brother, and that before the unbelievers.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt46006007-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v46006007-1">7 </span> Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you, because ye go to law one with another. Why do ye not rather take wrong? why do ye not rather <span class="add">suffer yourselves to</span> be defrauded?  </span><span class="verse" id="vt46006008-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v46006008-1">8 </span> Nay, ye do wrong, and defraud, and that <span class="add">your</span> brethren.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt46006009-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v46006009-1">9 </span> Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,  </span><span class="verse" id="vt46006010-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v46006010-1">10 </span> Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt46006011-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v46006011-1">11 </span> And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God. </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt46006012-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v46006012-1">12 </span> All things are lawful unto me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt46006013-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v46006013-1">13 </span> Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall destroy both it and them. Now the body <span class="add">is</span> not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt46006014-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v46006014-1">14 </span> And God hath both raised up the Lord, and will also raise up us by his own power.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt46006015-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v46006015-1">15 </span> Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ? shall I then take the members of Christ, and make <span class="add">them</span> the members of an harlot? God forbid.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt46006016-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v46006016-1">16 </span> What? know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is one body? for two, saith he, shall be one flesh.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt46006017-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v46006017-1">17 </span> But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt46006018-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v46006018-1">18 </span> Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the body; but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt46006019-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v46006019-1">19 </span> What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost <span class="add">which is</span> in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own?  </span><span class="verse" id="vt46006020-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v46006020-1">20 </span> For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God’s. </span></p>
