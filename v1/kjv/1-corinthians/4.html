and what hast thou that thou didst not receive? now if thou didst receive <span class="add">it</span>, why dost thou glory, as if thou hadst not received <span class="add">it</span>?  </span><span class="verse" id="vt46004008-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v46004008-1">8 </span> Now ye are full, now ye are rich, ye have reigned as kings without us: and I would to God ye did reign, that we also might reign with you.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt46004009-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v46004009-1">9 </span> For I think that God hath set forth us the apostles last, as it were appointed to death: for we are made a spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt46004010-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v46004010-1">10 </span> We <span class="add">are</span> fools for Christ’s sake, but ye <span class="add">are</span> wise in Christ; we <span class="add">are</span> weak, but ye <span class="add">are</span> strong; ye <span class="add">are</span> honourable, but we <span class="add">are</span> despised.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt46004011-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v46004011-1">11 </span> Even unto this present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain dwellingplace;  </span><span class="verse" id="vt46004012-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v46004012-1">12 </span> And labour, working with our own hands: being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we suffer it:  </span><span class="verse" id="vt46004013-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v46004013-1">13 </span> Being defamed, we intreat: we are made as the filth of the world, <span class="add">and are</span> the offscouring of all things unto this day.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt46004014-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v46004014-1">14 </span> I write not these things to shame you, but as my beloved sons I warn <span class="add">you</span>.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt46004015-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v46004015-1">15 </span> For though ye have ten thousand instructers in Christ, yet <span class="add">have ye</span> not many fathers: for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt46004016-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v46004016-1">16 </span> Wherefore I beseech you, be ye followers of me.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt46004017-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v46004017-1">17 </span> For this cause have I sent unto you Timotheus, who is my beloved son, and faithful in the Lord, who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which be in Christ, as I teach every where in every church.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt46004018-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v46004018-1">18 </span> Now some are puffed up, as though I would not come to you.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt46004019-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v46004019-1">19 </span> But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord will, and will know, not the speech of them which are puffed up, but the power.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt46004020-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v46004020-1">20 </span> For the kingdom of God <span class="add">is</span> not in word, but in power.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt46004021-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v46004021-1">21 </span> What will ye? shall I come unto you with a rod, or in love, and <span class="add">in</span> the spirit of meekness? </span></p>
