Go and speak to Zedekiah king of Judah, and tell him, Thus saith the <span class="nd">LORD</span>; Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire:  </span><span class="verse" id="vt24034003-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v24034003-1">3 </span> And thou shalt not escape out of his hand, but shalt surely be taken, and delivered into his hand;

I made a covenant with your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondmen, saying,  </span><span class="verse" id="vt24034014-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v24034014-1">14 </span> At the end of seven years let ye go every man his brother an Hebrew, which hath been sold unto thee;

Ye have not hearkened unto me, in proclaiming liberty, every one to his brother, and every man to his neighbour: behold, I proclaim a liberty for you, saith the <span class="nd">LORD</span>, to the sword, to the pestilence, and to the famine;
