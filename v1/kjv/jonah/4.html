Therefore I fled before unto Tarshish: for I knew that thou <span class="add">art</span> a gracious God, and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and repentest thee of the evil.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt32004003-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v32004003-1">3 </span> Therefore now, O <span class="nd">LORD</span>, take, I beseech thee, my life from me; for <span class="add">it is</span> better for me to die than to live. </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt32004004-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v32004004-1">4 </span>¶ Then said the <span class="nd">LORD</span>, Doest thou well to be angry?<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*</a> </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt32004005-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v32004005-1">5 </span> So Jonah went out of the city, and sat on the east side of the city, and there made him a booth, and sat under it in the shadow, till he might see what would become of the city.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt32004006-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v32004006-1">6 </span> And the <span class="nd">LORD</span> God prepared a gourd, and made <span class="add">it</span> to come up over Jonah, that it might be a shadow over his head, to deliver him from his grief.
