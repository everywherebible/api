So I lifted up mine eyes the way toward the north, and behold northward at the gate of the altar this image of jealousy in the entry.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt26008006-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v26008006-1">6 </span> He said furthermore unto me, Son of man, seest thou what they do? <span class="add">even</span> the great abominations that the house of Israel committeth  here, that I should go far off from my sanctuary? but turn thee yet again, <span class="add">and</span> thou shalt see greater abominations. </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt26008007-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v26008007-1">7 </span>¶ And he brought me to the door of the court; and when I looked, behold a hole in the wall.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt26008008-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v26008008-1">8 </span> Then said he unto me, Son of man, dig now in the wall: and when I had digged in the wall, behold a door.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt26008009-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v26008009-1">9 </span> And he said unto me, Go in, and behold the wicked abominations that they do here.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt26008010-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v26008010-1">10 </span> So I went in and saw; and behold every form of creeping things, and abominable beasts, and all the idols of the house of Israel, pourtrayed upon the wall round about.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt26008011-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v26008011-1">11 </span> And there stood before them seventy men of the ancients of the house of Israel, and in the midst of them stood Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan, with every man his censer in his hand; and a thick cloud of incense went up.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt26008012-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v26008012-1">12 </span> Then said he unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen what the ancients of the house of Israel do in the dark, every man in the chambers of his imagery? for they say, The <span class="nd">LORD</span> seeth us not; the <span class="nd">LORD</span> hath forsaken the earth. </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt26008013-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v26008013-1">13 </span>¶ He said also unto me, Turn thee yet again, <span class="add">and</span> thou shalt see greater abominations that they do.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt26008014-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v26008014-1">14 </span> Then he brought me to the door of the gate of the <span class="nd">LORD’s</span> house which <span class="add">was</span> toward the north; and, behold, there sat women weeping for Tammuz. </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt26008015-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v26008015-1">15 </span>¶ Then said he unto me, Hast thou seen <span class="add">this</span>, O son of man? turn thee yet again, <span class="add">and</span> thou shalt see greater abominations than these.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt26008016-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v26008016-1">16 </span> And he brought me into the inner court of the <span class="nd">LORD’s</span> house, and, behold, at the door of the temple of the <span class="nd">LORD</span>, between the porch and the altar, <span class="add">were</span> about five and twenty men, with their backs toward the temple of the <span class="nd">LORD</span>, and their faces toward the east; and they worshipped the sun toward the east. </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt26008017-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v26008017-1">17 </span>¶ Then he said unto me, Hast thou seen <span class="add">this</span>, O son of man? Is it a light thing to the house of Judah that they commit the abominations which they commit here? for they have filled the land with violence, and have returned to provoke me to anger: and, lo, they put the branch to their nose.<a href="#FN1" class="footnote">*</a>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt26008018-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v26008018-1">18 </span> Therefore will I also deal in fury: mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity: and though they cry in mine ears with a loud voice, <span class="add">yet</span> will I not hear them. </span></p>
