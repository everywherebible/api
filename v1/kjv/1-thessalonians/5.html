then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt52005004-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v52005004-1">4 </span> But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt52005005-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v52005005-1">5 </span> Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt52005006-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v52005006-1">6 </span> Therefore let us not sleep, as <span class="add">do</span> others;
