But they thought to do me mischief.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt16006003-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v16006003-1">3 </span> And I sent messengers unto them, saying, I <span class="add">am</span> doing a great work, so that I cannot come down: why should the work cease, whilst I leave it, and come down to you?  </span><span class="verse" id="vt16006004-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v16006004-1">4 </span> Yet they sent unto me four times after this sort; and I answered them after the same manner.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt16006005-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v16006005-1">5 </span> Then sent Sanballat his servant unto me in like manner the fifth time with an open letter in his hand;  </span><span class="verse" id="vt16006006-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v16006006-1">6 </span>Wherein <span class="add">was</span> written, It is reported among the heathen, and Gashmu saith <span class="add">it, that</span> thou and the Jews think to rebel: for which cause thou buildest the wall, that thou mayest be their king, according to these words.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*</a>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt16006007-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v16006007-1">7 </span> And thou hast also appointed prophets to preach of thee at Jerusalem, saying, <span class="add">There is</span> a king in Judah: and now shall it be reported to the king according to these words. Come now therefore, and let us take counsel together.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt16006008-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v16006008-1">8 </span> Then I sent unto him, saying, There are no such things done as thou sayest, but thou feignest them out of thine own heart.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt16006009-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v16006009-1">9 </span> For they all made us afraid, saying, Their hands shall be weakened from the work, that it be not done. Now therefore, <span class="add">O God</span>, strengthen my hands. </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt16006010-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v16006010-1">10 </span> Afterward I came unto the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah the son of Mehetabeel, who <span class="add">was</span> shut up; and he said, Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us shut the doors of the temple: for they will come to slay thee; yea, in the night will they come to slay thee.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt16006011-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v16006011-1">11 </span> And I said, Should such a man as I flee? and who <span class="add">is there</span>, that, <span class="add">being</span> as I <span class="add">am</span>, would go into the temple to save his life? I will not go in.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt16006012-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v16006012-1">12 </span> And, lo, I perceived that God had not sent him; but that he pronounced this prophecy against me: for Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt16006013-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v16006013-1">13 </span>Therefore <span class="add">was</span> he hired, that I should be afraid, and do so, and sin, and <span class="add">that</span> they might have <span class="add">matter</span> for an evil report, that they might reproach me.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt16006014-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v16006014-1">14 </span> My God, think thou upon Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their works, and on the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest of the prophets, that would have put me in fear. </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt16006015-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v16006015-1">15 </span>¶ So the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth <span class="add">day</span> of <span class="add">the month</span> Elul, in fifty and two days.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt16006016-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v16006016-1">16 </span> And it came to pass, that when all our enemies heard <span class="add">thereof</span>, and all the heathen that <span class="add">were</span> about us saw <span class="add">these things</span>, they were much cast down in their own eyes: for they perceived that this work was wrought of our God. </span></p><p> <span class="verse" id="vt16006017-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v16006017-1">17 </span>¶ Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters unto Tobiah, and <span class="add">the letters</span> of Tobiah came unto them.<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†</a>  </span><span class="verse" id="vt16006018-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v16006018-1">18 </span>For <span class="add">there were</span> many in Judah sworn unto him, because he <span class="add">was</span> the son in law of Shechaniah the son of Arah; and his son Johanan had taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah.  </span><span class="verse" id="vt16006019-1"><span class="verse-num" id="v16006019-1">19 </span> Also they reported his good deeds before me, and uttered my words to him. <span class="add">And</span> Tobiah sent letters to put me in fear.<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡</a> </span></p>
